<hr class="tiny" />

<h3>EARTH, AIR AND WATER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the wavering path which followed the
twisting summit of the cliffs toiled a little figure.
His face was tanned, and from under a brown
tangle of hair looked eyes blue and fearless.</p>

<p>He had walked a mile, and home lay a mile
further, where white-painted cottages glowed
against the close green velvet of the hills. The
way ran staggeringly, and the boy was tired.</p>

<p>A group of ragged children tossed up their
caps and shouted from the cluster of fishermen&#8217;s
huts set further back from the sea; he did not
heed them, but seated himself on the tufted panic-grass
and turned his eyes seaward. The hot sun
slanted silver-bright flashes from the moody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
water, and whistling swallows, beyond the cliff-edge,
soared and dropped against the blue of the
sky, like black balls from a juggler&#8217;s hands. A
light breeze, lifting, ruffled with a million ripples
the gray surge, played along the path in scurrying
dust-whorls and cooled his hot cheeks.</p>

<p>On its heels came stealthily a yellowish dimness;
a sullen bank of cloud crept swiftly along
the northern horizon. From a thin, black line, it
grew to a pall, rising ominous and threatening.
Quick flashes pricked its jagged edge. Beneath
it the sea turned to a weight of liquid lead.</p>

<p>The boy Richard rose fascinated, his eyes upon
the advancing squall, his ears open to the rising
breathing of the waves, troubled by under-dreams.
His lips were parted eagerly, and his
browned hands clutched at the brim of his hat.
Often and often, from his window, he had seen
the power of the storm; now its near and intimate
presence throbbed through him.</p>

<p>The foremost gust struck him with sudden
fury, turning him about as though with strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hands upon his shoulders, and tearing his hat
from his grasp. He caught his breath with a
sense of outraged dignity; then, bending his head
resolutely to the onslaught, he stumbled forward.
The air was full of scudding mist-streaks, and
twisted roots caught at his feet in the half-darkness.
The fierce wind tore with its claws at the
little jacket, buttoned bravely, and tossed the
damp, rebellious hair. The fishermen&#8217;s huts lay
just behind him, a dry and beckoning shelter;
before him, for a few paces, stretched the path
leading into ghostly obscurity. The boy bent
low, bracing his legs doggedly against the stubble,
and foot by foot went on along that lone mile
into the storm.</p>

<p>On a sudden the blurred sea-view was swallowed
up. The wind swooped, grasping at his
ankles. It picked up pebbles and flung them,
howling, against his body. They stung like heavy
hail. It snapped off unwilling twigs from the
cringing bushes and dashed them into the childish
face. But he did not retreat. What was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wind that it should force him back! A mighty
determination was in his little soul. His teeth
were tight clenched, and his legs ached with the
strain. The blast caught away his breath and he
turned his back to it. At the moment it seemed
to lull, tempting him to go its way, but he would
not yield.</p>

<p>Then the tempest gathered all its forces and
hurled them spitefully, hatefully against him,
barring, lashing him cruelly, thrusting him backward.
He dropped upon his knees in the path,
giving not an inch. The wind, sopped with heavy
rain, fell upon him bodily. He stretched himself
flat, winding his fingers among the roots of the
wiry grasses, struck down, bruised, but still unconquered.</p>

<p>A lone, pied gull, careening sidelong through
the wind-rifts, roused in him a helpless frenzy of
anger and resentment. He clenched his tiny fist
and shook it at the sky, choking, gasping, sobbing,
great tears of impotent rage and mortification
blown across his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<h3>FIRE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> red-gold of the sun still warmed the late
summer dusk. The fading light sifted between
the curtains of the window and touched lovingly
the checkered coverlid, moulding into soft outline
the rounded little limbs beneath. The long
hair spread goldenly across the pillow, and the
wide brown eyes were open.</p>

<p>Old Anne was going to die&mdash;old Anne with the
ugly wrinkled face and bony fingers from which
all the children ran. She was going to die that
night. Margaret had heard it whispered among
the servants. That very same night while she
herself was asleep in bed! Her soul was going
to leave her body and fly up to God.</p>

<p>She wondered how it would look, but she knew
it would be very beautiful. Its back would not
be bent, nor its face drawn with shining burn-scars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
It would be young and straight, and it
would have wings&mdash;long, white wings, such as
the angels had in the big stained-glass window
over the choir-box in the chapel. It would have
a ring of light around its head, such as the moon
had on misty evenings. It would go just at the
moment when old Anne died, and those who
watched close enough might see. Would it
speak? Or would it go so swiftly that it could
only smile for a good-by? She wondered if its
eyes would be kindly and blue, not dim and
watery as Anne&#8217;s had been. Her own face was
smoother and prettier than Anne&#8217;s, but her eyes
were dark. Angels always had blue eyes. Its
face would be turned up toward heaven, where it
was going, and its wings would make a soft,
whispering sound, like a pigeon&#8217;s when it starts
to fly. One would have to be very quick, but if
one were there at just the right minute, one could
see it.</p>

<p>Oh, if <i>she</i> only could! She felt quite sure she
would not be afraid of Anne then, knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
she was just going to be an angel! If they
would only let her! She was so little, and they
would be watching, so that maybe they would not
notice her. Perhaps she could slip in quietly on
tiptoe, and then she would see a real shining soul,
such as she herself had inside of her, and which
she loved to imagine sometimes looked out of her
eyes at her from the looking-glass. A breathless
eagerness seized her, and she sat up in the bed,
hugging her knees and resting her chin upon
them.</p>

<p>She listened a moment; the house was very
still. Then she threw down the covers, and
jumped in her bare feet to the floor. She sat
down on the rug in her white nightgown, and
pulled on her stockings with nervous haste, and
her shoes, leaving them unbuttoned and flapping.
Then she slipped into her muslin dress, fastening
it behind at the neck and waist, and opened the
door, tugging at the big brass knob, and quaking
at its complaining creaks. No one was in sight,
and the little figure, with its bright floating hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and rosy skin showing between its shoulders like
a belated locust, stole fearfully down the dim
stairway, along the deserted hall, and sidling
through the half-opened door, stepped out among
the long-fingered glooms of the standing shrubbery.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, frightened at the outdoor
dark, and then, catching her breath, ran
quickly around the corner of the house, and
down the drive toward the low, clapboarded
structure beside the stables, where a lighted window-shade
with moving shadows pointed out the
room of that solemn presence.</p>

<p>The night air was warm and heavy, and its
door stood wide. She crept up close and listened.
Between low-muttered words of subdued conversation,
she heard a slow and labored breathing&mdash;a
breathing now stopping, now beginning
again, and with a curious rattle in it which somehow
awed her. From where she crouched, she
could see only the foot of the bed, with its tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bare posts. There seemed to be expectancy in
the hushed voices within, and a quick fear seized
her lest she should miss the wonderful sight.
Quivering with eagerness, she rose to her feet,
and with her fascinated gaze seeking out the old
face on the pillow, stepped straight forward into
the room.</p>

<p>She heard a rising murmur of astonishment,
of protest, and before her light-blinded eyes had
found their way, felt herself seized roughly, unceremoniously,
lifted bodily off her feet and
borne out into the night. She heard, through the
passionate resentment of her childish mind, the
soothing endearments of Jem the gardener, and
she struggled to loose herself, beating at his face
with her hands and sobbing with helpless suffocation
of anger.</p>

<p>A frightened maid met them at the door and
took her from him, carrying her to her room to
undress her and sit by her till she should fall
asleep. No assurance that old Anne would soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
be happy in heaven comforted her. No one
understood, and she was too hurt to explain what
she had wanted.</p>

<p>So she lay through the long hours, the bitter
tears of grief and disappointment wetting her
pillow.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">I.</h2></div>


<p>The air above the shelving stretches of sand-beach
shimmered and dilated with the heat of the
August afternoon, as Margaret walked just beyond
the yeasty edge of the receding waves.
There was little wind stirring, and the cool damp
was pleasant under her feet. She had left the
hotel behind, and the straggling line of bobbing,
dark-blue specks, which indicated the habitual
bathers, was small in the distance.</p>

<p>A blue-and-silver bound book was in her hand,
and her gray tweed skirt and soft jacket, with a
bunch of drooping crimson roses at the waist,
made a grateful spot upon the white glare. Summer
sun and sea-wind had given a clear olive to
her face and a scarlet radiance to her full lips,
softly curved. Her hair, in waving masses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
flush-brown, flowed out from beneath her straw
hat, tempting a breeze.</p>

<p>To her left were tumbled monotonous, low
dunes, and beyond them the torn clayey bank,
gashed by storms; to her right, only barren
stretch of sea and sweep of sky.</p>

<p>At a bight of the shore, under the long, curved
hole of a pine, leaning to its fall from the high
bank through which half its naked roots struck
sprangling, ran a zigzag footpath to a little
grove, where hemlock and stunted oak grew
thickly. Up she climbed, poising lightly, and
drawing herself to the last step by grasping a
sprawling creeper. The green coolness refreshed
her, and there was more movement in the higher
air.</p>

<p>She followed the twists of the path among the
low bushes clustering in front of a sparse clearing.
Facing her, in the edge of the shade, where
the light fell in mottled shadows upon a soft,
springy floor of dead pine needles, with its wide
arms laced in the rasping boughs of the scrub-oaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
around it, stood an unwieldy wooden cross,
hewed roughly, its base socketed in stone and its
horizontal bar held in place by a rust-red bolt. A
cracked and crazy bench, also hewn, was set beneath,
and just above this was nailed a heavy
board in which was deeply cut this half-effaced
inscription:</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center"><span class="antiqua">
Here Lies<br />
The Body of an Unknown Woman<br />
Drowned<br />
In the Wreck of the Schooner Bartlett,<br />
May 9, 1871.</span></p></div>

<p>and below it, in larger characters, now almost
obliterated by gray-and-yellow stains:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><span class="antiqua">Ora Pro Anima Sua.</span></span></p>

<p>This was Margaret&#8217;s favorite spot. She preferred
its melancholy solitude to the vivacious
companionship of the cottage piazza, and its
quiet tones to the bizarre hues of the beach pavilion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
It lay removed from the usual paths,
reached only by a wide detour, across bush-tangled
wastes or the long, uncomfortable walk
up-shore on the hot, yielding sand. Now she
sank upon the seat with a deep sigh of pleasure,
letting her book fall open in her lap. Her eyes
roved far off across the gray-green heave where
a buccaneering fish-hawk slanted craftily.</p>

<p>A deeper light was in them as they fell upon
the open printed leaf:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="first">&#8220;For Love is fine and tense as silver wire,</div>
<div class="verse">Fierce as white lightning, glorious as drums</div>
<div class="verse">And beautiful as snow-mountains. Swift she is</div>
<div class="verse">As leaping flame and calm as winter stars.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Its chaste beauty had long ago stamped the
passage upon her memory; to-day the lines
hymned themselves to a subtle, splendid music.</p>

<p>Tossing the volume suddenly to one side, her
hands loosed her belt. She held the limp band
movelessly a moment, and then bent her face
eagerly over it. Under her fingers the filigree of
the clasp slid back, disclosing a portrait. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that of a man, young, resolute-faced, with brown,
wavy hair parted in the middle, and candid forehead.
It was rugged and masterful, but with a
sweetness of lips and a tender, gray softness of
proud eyes that bespoke him not more a doer
than a dreamer.</p>

<p>As she looked, her lips parted and a faint color
crept up her neck, showing brightly against the
auburn hollows of her hair. She fondled and
petted the ivory with her hands, and then raised
it to her lips, kissing it, murmuring to it, and
folding it over and over in the warm moistness
of her breath.</p>

<p>Holding it against her face, she walked up and
down the open space with quick, pushing steps,
her free hand stripping the leaves from the
sweeping bush fronds, her hat fallen back, swaying
from the knotted streamers caught under the
slipping coil between her shoulders. Stopping at
length in front of the bench, she hung the belt
upon a corner of the carven board, its violet
weave tinging the weathered grain and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
painted circlet glowing like a jewelled period for
the massive lettering.</p>

<p>With one knee on the warped seat, she read
again the fading sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;An unknown woman.&#8221; Gone down into the
cold green depths! Perhaps with a dear, glowing
secret in her heart, a one name bubbling from
her lips, a new quivering something in her soul,
which the waters could not still! That body buffeted
and tossed by rearing breakers, to lie nameless
in a neglected grave; that soul, its earthly
longing forgotten, to go forever unregretful of
what it had cried for with all the might of its
human passion!</p>

<p>Ah! but <i>did it</i>? If death touched her own
soul to-day! &#8220;For love is strong as death. * * *
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can
the floods drown it!&#8221; In imagination she felt the
numbing clasp of the dragging under-deeps; she
saw her soul wandering, wraith-like, through
shadowless, silent spaces and across infinite distances.
Would it bear with it a placid joy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Would it know no quicker heart-beat, no tears
that reddened the eyelid, no tender thrill in all its
lucent veins? Would nothing, nothing of that
strange, sweet wildness that ran imprisoned in all
her blood cling to it still?</p>

<p>The thought bit her. She reached up and
snatched down the belt, pressing the clasp tightly
with her cheek in the curve of her shoulder, repeating
dumbly to herself the pious &#8220;Ora pro
anima sua&#8221; that stood before her eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A far crackling struck across her mood, and
hastily drawing the belt about her waist, she
leaned sideways from the upright beam, raising
her hand quickly, as if to put back the lawless
meshes of her hair. She heard the sound of a
confident step, crunching on the marly sand, and
the swish of bent-back bushes. It was coming
in a direct line toward her. There was a dry
clatter of falling fence-rails, as though the intruder,
disdaining obstacles, preferred to walk
through them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>She caught a glimpse of a familiar, bright-colored
scarf between the glimmering, leafy
tangles, and then the thrust of a quick spring,
and an instant later the figure that had vaulted
the heavy fence came dropping, feet foremost,
through the snapping screen of brambles, and
walked straight toward the spot where she had
risen to her feet with a little glad cry.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">
II.</h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; he said peremptorily.
They were on a pebbly spur of the descending
path, and Daunt had leaped down below her. As
she stretched it out to him, he drew it sharply
toward him. She felt herself grasped firmly in
his arms, swung off and lifted to the smooth
level beneath. She could feel his uneven breaths
stirring in the roots of her hair, and his wrists
straining. Her head fell against his shoulder
and her look met his, startled. His sunburned
face was pale, and his gray eyes were hazed with
a daring softness.</p>

<p>Then, as she lay passive in his arms, a fiery
longing grew swiftly in them, and he suddenly
bent his head and kissed her&mdash;again and again.
She felt her unused mouth moulding to answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
kisses beneath his own, and her cheeks rushing
into a flame. Through her closed lids the
sun hung like a rosy mist of woven sparkles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you!&mdash;<i>you!</i>&mdash;<i>you!</i>&#8221; he said, stammering
and hoarsely. &#8220;I <i>love</i> you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tumbling passion of the utterance pierced
through her like a spear of desperate gladness.
Every nerve reached and quivered, tendril-like.
His deep breathing, toned with the dripping lap
of the shingle seemed to throb through her. She
lay quiet, breathless, her lashes drooped, her very
skin tense under the lasting burn of his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret! Ardee, dear! Look at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes flowed into his. From a blur under
cloud-pale eyelids, they had turned to violet balls,
shot through with a trembling light. The look
she gave him melted over him in a rage of love.
Desire bordered it, a smile dipped in it, promise
made it golden, and he saw his own longing
painted in it as a pilgrim sees his reflection in a
slumbering pool.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands on his head, pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
back his cloth cap, and framing his face in the
long, sweeping oval of her arms. He could feel
little vibrant thrills in her fingers. He held her
tightly, masterfully, first at arm&#8217;s length, laughing
into her wide eyes, and then close, folding
her, pressing her hair with his hands.</p>

<p>The leaves from the roses she wore fell in
splotches of deep red, sprinkling the brown-veined
sand at their feet; the dense, bruised odor,
mixed with the salty breath of seaweed, seemed
to fill and choke all her swaying senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like a storm!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have dreamed
of it coming at the last gently, like a bright
morning, but it isn&#8217;t like that! It seemed as if
that were the way it would come to me&mdash;like a
still, small voice&mdash;but it isn&#8217;t! It&#8217;s the wind and
the earthquake and the fire! Oh!&#8221; she said,
drawing her breath in a long, shuddering inhalation.
&#8220;Do you smell that rose-scent? Did ever
any roses smell like that? They&mdash;they make me
dizzy! Feel me tremble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every pulsation of her frame ran through him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with a swift, delicious sensation, like the touching
of rough velvet. Her curling hair, where it
sprang against his neck, ridged his skin with a
creeping delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are like a great,
tall, yellow lily. Some gnome has drawn amber
streaks in your hair&mdash;it shines like a gold-stone&mdash;and
rubbed your cheeks with a pink tulip leaf!
And your lips are like&mdash;no, they are like nothing
but ripe strawberries! Nobody could ever
describe your eyes; they are most like a bed of
purple violets set in a brown cloud with the sun
shining through it. Tell me!&#8221; he said suddenly.
&#8220;Do you love me? Do you? Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! yes! yes! Oh,&#8221; she breathed, &#8220;what
is there in your hands? I want them to touch
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed his palms lightly along the bow-like
curve of her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is like fire and flowers and music,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;all rolled into one. And those roses! They
are attar. The sand looks as if it were bleeding!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>&#8220;Shall you think of me when I am on the train
to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time&mdash;every minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to-morrow, while I am in the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Monday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will come back to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He strained her to him in the white sunlight,
and kissed her again, on the lips and forehead
and hands, and she clung to him, lifting her face
to him eagerly and passionately.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Margaret stood watching the firm-knit figure
as it crossed the sand space. She saw the lift of
his lithe shoulders as he pulled himself up the
bank, saw his form splashed against the sky, saw
the flutter of his handkerchief as he flung her a
last signal.</p>

<p>She waved her hand in return, and he disappeared.</p>

<p>Then she ran to a slant spile rising lonely from
the sand, and sank down quivering. It seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her as if she could bear no more joy; her body
ached with it. She threw up her hands and
laughed aloud in sheer ecstasy.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that she had left her
book in the grove, and she stumbled up and
walked back slowly, smiling and humming an air
as she went along.</p>

<p>The first shade of the dimming afternoon lay
under the trees as she climbed again to the little
clearing, and the sunbeams glanced obliquely
from the crooked oak branches. The air was
very still and freighted only with the soft swish
of the ebb-tide and the clean fragrance of balsam.
Her book lay open and face down on the plank
seat. She picked it up and sat down, leaning
back.</p>

<p>She was still humming, low-voiced, and as she
sat she began to sing&mdash;not strongly, but hushed,
as though for a drowsy ear&mdash;with her face lifted
and her dreamy eyes upon the sea margin.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was Daunt&#8217;s song, the one he most loved to
hear her sing. But to-day it had a new, rich
meaning. She stretched her hands on either side,
grasping the seat, and sang on to the bending
boughs, rubbing slowly against the weather-stained
beam arms above her head:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The shade grew darker as she sat. It deepened
the brown of her eyes and the sea-bloom in
her cheeks, and the loitering lilac of the west
touched the coils of her hair, as they lay against
the gray board, blotting with their living bronze
the half-effaced, forgotten inscription:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><i>Pray for Her Soul.</i></span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III.</h2></div>


<p>In the pause before the service began, Margaret&#8217;s
eyes drifted aimlessly about the dim body
of the small but pretentious seaside chapel. It
held the same incongruous gathering so often to
be seen at coast resorts, a mingling of ultra-fashionable
summer visitors, and homely and uncomfortably
well-dressed village folk. There was
Mrs. Atherton, whose bounty had elevated the
parish from a threadbare existence, with simple
service and plain altar furniture, to a devout adherence
to High Church methods, with candles
and rich vestments, and a never-failing welcome
for stylish visiting clergymen from the city;
there was the wife of the proprietor of the Beach
Hotel, whose costumes were always faithful second
editions of Mrs. Atherton&#8217;s; there were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
rector&#8217;s two daughters and the usual sprinkling
of familiar faces that she had passed on the drive
or the beach walk.</p>

<p>The lawn outside was shimmering with the
heat that had followed an over-night shower,
and the pewed calm oppressed her. Her limbs
were nettled with teasing pricks of restlessness.</p>

<p>The open windows let in a heavy, drenched
rose-odor, tinged with a distant salt smell of sea.
The air was weighted with it&mdash;it was the same
mingled odor that had filled her nostrils when
she stood with Daunt on the shore, with the wet
wind in their faces and fluttering petals of the
crushed roses she had worn staining the dun
sand and crisp, strown seaweed like great drops
of blood. It overpowered her senses. She
breathed it deeply, feeling a delicious intoxication,
and its suggested memory ran through her
veins like an ethereal ichor, tingling to her finger
ends.</p>

<p>Her eyes, heavy and swimming, were full of
the iridescent colors of the stained-glass window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
opposite, with the dull yellow aureole about the
head of the central figure. The hues wove and
blended in a background of subdued harmony,
lending life and seeming movement to the
features.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man somewhat tall and comely, his hair the
color of a ripe chestnut, curling and waving.&#8221;
The description recurred to her, not as though
written to the Roman Senate by Lentulus, Governor
of Judea, but as if printed in bossed letters
about the rim of the picture. &#8220;In the middle of
his head a seam parteth it, after the manner of
the Nazarites. His forehead is plain and very
delicate, his face without spot or wrinkle, beautified
with a lovely red; his nose and mouth of
charming symmetry. His look is very innocent
and mature; his eyes gray, clear and quick. His
body is straight and well proportioned, his hands
and arms most delectable to behold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyes gray, clear and quick.&#8221; From the
window they followed her&mdash;the eyes that had
looked into hers on the beach, full of longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
light&mdash;the eyes that had charmed her and had
seemed to draw up her soul to look back at them.</p>

<p>She dragged her gaze away with a quick shudder,
to a realization of her surroundings. A
paining recoil seized her at the temerity of her
thought, and her imaginings shrank within themselves.
A vivid shame bathed her soul. She
felt half stifled.</p>

<p>The dulled and droning intonation of the
reader came to her as something banal and shop-worn.
He was large and heavy-voiced. His hair
was sandy and thin, and his skin was of that peculiar
pallor and pursiness bred of lack of exercise
and a full diet. It reminded her irresistibly
of pink plush. He had a double chin, and
he intoned with eyes cast down, and his large
hands clasped before him, after the fashion
affected by the higher church. His monotonous
and nasal utterance glossed the periods with
unctuous and educated mispronunciation. The
congregation was punctuated with nodding
heads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>To Margaret, listening dully, there seemed to
be an inexpressible incongruity between the man
and the office, between the face and the robes,
which should have lent a spirituality. She
looked about her furtively. Surely, surely she
must see that thought reflected from other faces;
but her range of vision took in only countenances
overflowing with conscious Sabbath rectitude,
heads nodding with rhythmic sleepiness
and eyes shining with churchly complacency.
Suddenly through the rolling periods the meaning
struck through to Margaret, and her wandering
mind was instantly arrested.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>For they that are after the flesh do mind the
things of the flesh; but they that are of the
Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally
minded is death, but to be spiritually
minded is life and peace.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She heard the words with painful eagerness.
Her mind seemed suddenly as acute, as quick to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
record impressions as though she had just awakened
from a long sleep.</p>

<p>A woman in a pew to Margaret&#8217;s right dropped
her prayer-book with a smart crash onto the
wooden floor. The smooth brows drew together
sharply and his voice, pauseless, took on a note
of asperity, of irritated displeasure. Reading was
a specialty of his, and to be interrupted spoiled
the general effect and displeased him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Because the carnal mind is enmity against
God: for it is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>So then they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>An old man, bent and deaf, sat close up under
the reader&#8217;s desk. He leaned forward with elbow
on knee and one open palm behind a hairy ear.
His eyes were raised, and his look was rapt.
Margaret could see his side-face from where she
sat. He saw only the sanctified figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
priest and heard no human monotone, but the
voice of God, speaking through the lips of His
anointed. He was a real worshipper. For her
the spiritual was swallowed up. That one bodily
image stood before her inner self. It had blotted
out her diviner view; it had even thrust itself behind
the flowing robes and sandaled feet and had
dared to usurp the place of the eternal symbol of
human spirituality!</p>

<p>She locked her hands about her prayer-book,
pinching them between her knees. The woman
directly in front of her wore a hot, figured silk
and a drab mull boa that looked dreadfully like
bunched caterpillars. The riotous rose-odor
made her faint and sick, and she had a horrible
feeling that the carved heads of the jutting stone
work were laughing evilly at her.</p>

<p>A strangling terror of herself seized her&mdash;a
terror of this new and hideous darkness that had
descended upon her spirit&mdash;a terror of this overmastering
impulse which threatened her soul. It
was part of the dominance of the flesh that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
senses should be opened only to itself, only to the
earthy and the lower. This penalty was already
upon her; of all in that congregation, she, only
she, must see the bestial lurking everywhere,
even in God&#8217;s house, and in the vestments of His
minister.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>So then they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>It was part of their punishment that they could
no longer please themselves. Out from every
shape of nature and art, from the shadows of
grove and the sunshine of open plain, from the
crowded street and from the silent church must
start forever this spectre, this unsightly comrade
of fleshly imagination. This was what it
meant to be carnally minded. Margaret&#8217;s soul
was weak and dizzy with pain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For in some such way will every woman cry.
The very purity of her soul will rise to bar out
the love that is of earth, earthy&mdash;the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
human love so young, so tender-eyed and warm-fingered,
and with the lovely earth-light that is
about its brows. And then, when the soul grows
weary of the pallid thoughts, when the chill of
the shadows strikes through&mdash;when the walls
grow cold and the soul lifts iron bar and chain to
let in the human sunshine, then the pale images
that throng the house gather and are frightened
at the very joy of the sun, and they try to shut
the door again against the shining, and sit sorrowful
in a trembling dark.</p>

<p>The cry of the woman is, &#8220;Give me soul! Give
me spirituality!&#8221; Oh, loved hand! Oh, eyes!
Oh, kissed lips and fondled hair! The woman&#8217;s
love gives to each of you a soul. You will shine
for her in her nethermost heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me not of my love,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;that it is
corporeal and must fade! Tell me only that it is
of the spirit, a fond and heavenly light, such as
never was in earthly sunrise or in evening star!
A soul, but not a body! An essence, but no substance!
It is too lovely to be of earth, too sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to be only of this failing human frame. Its
speech is the speech of angels, and its eyes are
like the cherubim. Tell me not that it is not all
of the soul!&#8221; So, until she dreams the last dream
of love in earth-gardens, until she closes her
soul&#8217;s eyes to dream of the humanity of love, the
dignity of human passion, until then she perfumes
the lily and paints the rose.</p>

<p>When the temperament that loves much and is
oversensitive opens the gates of its sense to
human passion, if its spiritual side recoils, it recoils
with self-renunciation and with tears. The
pain of such renunciation makes woman&#8217;s soul
weak. Its self-probings and the whips of its conscience,
made a very inquisitor, form for her a
present horror. She cries out for the old dream,
the old ideal, the old faith! It is the tears she
sheds for this which drop upon the wall of the
world&#8217;s convention and temper it to steel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the
flesh to live after the flesh. For, if ye live after</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<i>the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the
Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live.</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The droning voice of the reader hummed in
Margaret&#8217;s ears. She came to herself again, almost
with a start, dimly conscious that the
woman in crêpe in the next pew was watching
her narrowly. She must sit out the service. She
fell to studying the pattern of the embroidery on
the altar cloths. It was in curiously woven
arabesques, grouped about the monogram of
Christ. Anything to withdraw her eyes from the
face of the reader, for which she was beginning
to feel a growing and unreasoning repulsion.</p>

<p>Throughout the remainder of the sermon she
kept her gaze upon her open Bible, turning up
mechanically all the cross references to the word
&#8220;flesh.&#8221; She followed the contradistinction of
flesh and spirit through the New Testament. It
was the <i>flesh</i> lusting against the <i>spirit</i>, and the
<i>spirit</i> against the <i>flesh</i>, contrary the one to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
other. The lust of the flesh and the lust of the
eyes and the pride of life&mdash;these all of the
world.</p>

<p>The voice of the priest ran along in pauseless
flow. It seemed to Margaret that he was repeating,
with infinite variations, the same words
over and over: &#8220;So they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she rose for the final benediction, her knees
felt weak and she trembled violently. She remembered
what happened afterward only confusedly.
The next thing she really knew was the
sense of a moist apostolic palm pressed against
her forehead as she half sat on the stone bench to
the right of the entrance, and a smooth, rounded
voice saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Atherton! Mrs. Starr! will you come
back here a moment? This dear young woman
appears to be overcome with the heat!&#8221;</p>

<h3>Daunt to Margaret.</h3>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">New York</span>, Sunday Morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Very Own!&mdash;Is that the way to begin a
love letter? Anyhow, it is what I want to say.
It is what I have called you a thousand times, to
myself, since a one day far back&mdash;which I shall
tell you about some time&mdash;when I made up my
mind that you should love me. Does that sound
conceited? Did you ever guess it? Over a year
I have carried the thought with me; you have
loved me only half that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I have watched your love unfolding!
How I have hugged and treasured every new little
leaf! I have been afraid so long to touch it;
I wanted every petal full-blown, before I picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it, to be mine&mdash;mine, only mine, all mine, as long
as I lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I left you yesterday, to come up to this
dismal city, I have been so happy that I have
almost pinched myself to see if I were not asleep.
To think that all my richest dreams have come
true all at once!</p>

<p>&#8220;When I think of it, it makes me feel very
humble. I shall be more ambitious. I am going
to write better and truer. I must make you
proud of me! I am going to work hard. No
other man ever had such an incentive to grow&mdash;to
catch up with ideals&mdash;as I have, because no
other man ever had you to love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday I went directly from the train to
the club. I pulled one of the big chairs into a
shaded corner and closed my eyes to feel over
and over again the deliciousness of the afternoon.
I could feel your body in my arms and your head
hard against my shoulder and&mdash;that first kiss. It
has been on my lips ever since! I haven&#8217;t dared
even to smoke for fear it might vanish!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;All the while I had a curious, vivid, tumultuous
sense as though I were in especially close
touch with you. It seemed almost as if you
wanted to tell me something, and that <i>I couldn&#8217;t
quite hear</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;After I went to bed I could not sleep for happiness;
I wondered what you had been doing,
saying, thinking, dreaming&mdash;whether you thought
of me much, and, most of all, when you knelt
down that night! Shall I always be in the &#8216;Inner
Room,&#8217; and shall you look in often?</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter is such a pitiful makeshift! I could
go on writing pages! I want to put my arms
around you and whisper it in your ear!</p>

<p>&#8220;The church-bells are ringing now. I can picture
you sitting in the chapel, just as you do
every Sunday, and, maybe sometimes, just a
minute of course, stealing a little backward
thought of me!</p>

<p>&#8220;Always in my mind, you will be linked with
red roses, such as you wore <i>then</i>. To-day I am
sending you down a hamper of them. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
like to think of you to-night as sleeping nestled
up in them, and dreaming their perfume. I am
longing to see you. I feel as though I wanted to
roll the day up and push it away to get into to-morrow
quicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hardly be able to read this&mdash;my pen
runs away with me; but I know you can read
what is written over it all and between every two
lines&mdash;that I love you, I love you wholly, unalterably.</p>

<p>&#8220;God keep you, safe and sound, dearest, always,
always&mdash;for me!</p>

<h3>Margaret to Daunt.</h3>

<p class="right">&#8220;Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am leaving this morning for a long visit. I
cannot see you again. I have made up my mind
suddenly&mdash;since I saw you Saturday afternoon,
I mean. You will think this incomprehensible, I
know, but, believe me, I <i>must</i> go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of me as generously as you can. This
will hurt you, and to hurt you is the hardest part
of it. Do not think that I have treated our association
lightly. I could go upon my knees to beg
you not to believe that I have been deliberately
heartless. Remember me, not as the one who
writes you this now, but as the girl who walked
with you on the beach and who, for that one
hour, thought she saw heaven opened.</p>




<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Margaret Langdon.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<h3>Daunt to Margaret.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Dear:&mdash;You must let me write you. You
<i>must</i> listen! What does your letter mean?
What is the reason? If there had been anything
that could come between us, I know you well
enough to believe you would have told me before.
How can you expect me to accept such a dismissal?
I don&#8217;t understand it. What is it that
has changed you? What takes you from me?
Surely I have a right to know. Tell me! You
can&#8217;t intend to stay away. It&#8217;s monstrous! It&#8217;s
unthinkable! Explain this mystery!</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not believe, when I received your letter
to-day in the city, that you had written it. It
seemed an evil dream that I must wake up from.
Yet I have come back here to our summer haunt
to find it true and you gone. You have even left
me no address, and I must direct this letter to
your city number, hoping it will be forwarded
you.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;How can you ask me to submit to a final sentence
like this? I feel numbed and stung by the
suddenness of it! I can&#8217;t find myself. I can do
nothing but wrestle with the unguessable why of
your going. It&#8217;s beyond me.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that one afternoon on the sands, after
that delicious day of realization that my hopes
were true&mdash;that you loved me&mdash;to be flung aside
in a moment like an old glove, like a burnt-out
match, with no word of explanation, of reason&mdash;nothing!
It shan&#8217;t stay so! You can&#8217;t mean it!
You are a woman, a true, sweet woman; you
<i>shan&#8217;t</i> make me believe you a soulless flirt!
There is something else&mdash;something I must
know!</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel so helpless, writing to you. Space is a
monster. If I could only see you for a single
moment, I know it would be all right. Write to
me. Tell me what I want to know. Until I hear
something from you, I shall be utterly, endlessly
miserable.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;R. D.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>


<h3>Margaret to Daunt.</h3>

<p>&#8220;I cannot come back, Richard. I cannot even
explain to you why. Don&#8217;t humiliate me by writing
me for reasons. You would not understand
me. What good would it do to explain, when I
can hardly explain it to myself? I only <i>feel</i>, and
I am wretched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forget that afternoon! I am trying
to do the right thing&mdash;the thing that seems right
to myself. I must believe in my instinct; that is
all a woman has. I know this letter doesn&#8217;t tell
you anything&mdash;I can&#8217;t&mdash;there is no use&mdash;I <i>can&#8217;t</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;You know one thing. You must know that
that last day, when I kissed you, I did not think
of this. I did not intend to go away then. That
was all afterward. I had no idea of hurting or
wronging you&mdash;not the slightest!</p>

<p>&#8220;I know this is incoherent. I read over what
I have written and the lines get all jumbled up.
Somehow it seems to mean nothing. And yet it
means so much&mdash;oh, so horribly much!&mdash;to me.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;M.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<h3>Daunt to Margaret.</h3>

<p>&#8220;Dearest:&mdash;Please, please let me reason with
you. Don&#8217;t think me ungenerous; bear with me
a little. I <i>must</i> make you see it my way! I cheat
myself with such endless guessing. Can I have
grieved you or disappointed you? Have I
shocked those beautiful white ideals of yours in
any way? If that walk on the shore had been a
month ago, if we had been together since, I
might believe this; but we have not. That was
the last, <i>and you loved me then</i>! I brought my
naked heart to you that afternoon&mdash;it had been
yours for long!&mdash;and laid it in your hand. You
took it and kissed me, and I went away without
it. Have you weighed it in the balance and
found it wanting? Do you doubt what it could
give you? Dear, let it try!</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day I walked up the old glen where the
deserted cabin is. The very breeze went whispering
of you and the rustling of every bush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sounded like your name. The sky was duller and
the grass less green. Even the squirrels sat up
to ask where you were with the chestnuts you always
brought them. Nothing is the same; I am
infinitely lonely here, and yet I stay on where
everything means you! When I walk it seems as
if you must be waiting, smiling, just around
every bend of the rock&mdash;just behind every clump
of ferns&mdash;to tell me it was all a foolish fancy, that
you love me and have not gone away! You are
all things to me, dear. I cannot live without you.
I want you&mdash;I need you so! I never knew how
much before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only tell me what your letters have not, that
you do not love me&mdash;that you were mistaken&mdash;that
it was all a folly, a madness&mdash;and I will
never ask again! Ah, but I know you will not;
you cannot. You do! <i>You do!</i> I have that
one moment to remember when I held you in
my arms, when your throat throbbed against
my cheek, when your lips were on mine, when
your arms went up around my head, and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
could feel your heart beating quick against me.
Your breath was trembling and your eyes were
like stars! Can you ask me to forget that, the
moment that I seemed to have always lived and
kept myself for?</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible! This must be a passing mood
of yours which will vanish. Love is a stronger
thing than that! I don&#8217;t know the thing that
is troubling you&mdash;I can&#8217;t guess it&mdash;but I am
sure of <i>you</i>. I know you in a larger, deeper way,
and in the end you will never disappoint me in
that!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hoping, longing, waiting. Let me come
to you! Let me see you face to face, and read
there what the matter is!</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember that I am still</p>

<h3>Margaret to Daunt.</h3>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">&#8216;The Beeches,&#8217; Warne.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I have been touched by your last letter. I
had not intended to write again, yet somehow it
seems as if I must. Can you read between these
lines that I am unhappy? I have been to blame,
Richard, so much to blame; but I didn&#8217;t know it
till afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer your question; it isn&#8217;t whether
I love you&mdash;it&#8217;s <i>how</i>. Doesn&#8217;t that tell you anything?
I mustn&#8217;t be mistaken in the <i>way</i>. You
must not try to see me; it would only make me
more wretched than I am now, and that is a
great deal more than I could ever tell you.</p>

<h3>Daunt to Margaret.</h3>

<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t have any pity for yourself, for
heaven&#8217;s sake have some for me! What am <i>I</i>
to do? <i>I</i> haven&#8217;t any philosophy to bear on the
situation. I can&#8217;t understand your objections.
Your way of reasoning your emotions is simply
ghastly. The Lord never intended them to be
reasoned with! We can&#8217;t think ourselves into
love or out of it either. At least <i>I</i> can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve
gone too far to go backward. Since you went I
have been one long misery&mdash;one long, aching
homesickness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me not to &#8216;humiliate&#8217; you by
asking for your reasons. Don&#8217;t you think <i>I</i> am
humiliated? Don&#8217;t you think <i>I</i> suffer, too? And
yet it isn&#8217;t that; my love isn&#8217;t so mean a thing
that it is my vanity that is hurt most. If I believed
you didn&#8217;t love me, that might be; but if
you could leave me as you have&mdash;without a
chance to speak, with nothing but a line or two
that only maddened me&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to
tell me the truth now.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;You <i>do</i> love me, Margaret! You&#8217;re torturing
yourself and torturing me with some absurd hallucination.
Forgive me, dear&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that&mdash;only
it&#8217;s all so puzzling and it hurts me so!
I&#8217;m all raw and bleeding. My nerves are all
jangles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only see one thing clearly&mdash;that you
are wrong, and you&#8217;ll see it. Only somehow I
can&#8217;t make you see it yet!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">V.</h2></div>


<p>The warm October weather lay over the Drennen
homestead at Warne. This was a house
gigantic and austere, its gray stone walls throwing
into relief its red brick porch, veined with
ivy stems, like an Indian&#8217;s face, whose warrior
blood is raging, leant against a rock boulder.</p>

<p>Under the shade of the falling vine-fringe
Margaret sat, passive and quiet, on the veranda.
From under drooping lids, long-lashed, her
brown eyes looked out with a sort of sweet and
sober studiousness. Her reddish-brown hair appeared
the color of old metal beaten by the hammer
here and there into a lighter flick of gold,
rolling back from her straight forehead and
caught in a loose, low knot. The corners of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
mouth were lifted a little, giving an extra fulness
to sensitive lips, and the long rise of her
cheek, from chin to temple, was without a dimple.</p>

<p>The haze hung an opal tint over the blue hillsides
and lent to nearer objects a dreamy unreality.
The atmosphere reflected Margaret&#8217;s
mood. She was conscious of a certain tired
numbness. Her acts of the past few weeks had
a sort of elusiveness in perspective, and the old
house at Warne, with its gloomy stables, taciturn
servants, its familiar occupants&mdash;even she herself&mdash;seemed
to possess a curious unreality.</p>

<p>Across the field ran the wavering fringe of
willow which marked the little sluggish brook
with the foot-log, where often she had waded,
slim-legged, as a child. There was the old stable
loft from which she had once fallen, hunting for
pigeons&#8217; eggs. There were the same gloomy
holes under the eaves, from which awful bat
shapes had issued for her childish shuddering.
Only the master of the house was changed, and
he was Melwin Drennen, Lydia&#8217;s husband. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
child, he had carried her on his shoulders over the
fields when she had visited the place. She had
liked him unaffectedly, and the great sorrow of
his life had hurt her also.</p>

<p>She was a mere child then, and had heard it
with a vague and wondering pain. It had been a
much-talked-of match&mdash;that between her cousin
and this man&mdash;and it was only a week after the
wedding, at this same old place, that the accident
had happened. Lydia had been thrown from her
horse. She was carried back to a house of
mourning. The decorations were taken from the
walls, and great surgeons came down from the
city to ponder, shake their heads, and depart.
He, loving much, had hoped against hope. Margaret
remembered hearing how he had sat all one
night outside her door, silent, with his head
against the wainscoting and his hands tight together&mdash;the
night they said she would die.</p>

<p>And that was twelve years ago! She had bettered
slightly, grown stronger, walked a little,
then declined again. Now for five years past her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
life had been a colorless exchange of bed and reclining-chair,
and, in this period, she had never
left the house.</p>

<p>Margaret shivered in the sun as she thought.
At intervals she had heard of his life. &#8220;Such a
<i>lovely</i> life!&#8221; people said. She had thought of his
self-sacrifice and devotion as something very
beautiful. It had been an ever-present ideal to
her of spiritual love. In her own self-dissatisfaction
she had flown to this haven instinctively, as
to a dear example. A strange desire to stab herself
with the visual presence of her own lack had
possessed her. But in some way the steel had
failed her. She was conscious now of a vague
self-reproach that her greater sorrow was for
Melwin and not for the invalid. Surely Lydia
was the one to be sorry for, and yet there was an
awfulness about the life he led that she was
coming to feel acutely.</p>

<p>The crying incompletion, the negative hollowness
of it, had smote her. His full life had
stopped, like a sluggish stream. His vitality, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
energies, could not go ahead. He was bound
through all these years to the body of this death.
Love had broadened his gaze, lifted his horizon,
and then Fate had suddenly reared this crystal,
impassable wall, through which he must ever
gaze and ever be denied. He was condemned
still to love her and to watch agonizedly the slender
gradations, the imperceptible stages by
which she became less and less of her old self to
him.</p>

<p>Margaret gazed out across the velvet edge of
the hills, and felt a sense of dissatisfaction in the
color harmony. A doubt had darkened the windows
of her soul and turned the golden sunlight
to a duller chrome. She was so absorbed that
she caught a sharp breath as the French window
behind her clicked raspingly and swung inward
on its hinges. It was Melwin.</p>

<p>He came slowly forward through the window,
holding his head slightly on one side as though
he listened for something behind him. She
found herself wondering how he had acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the habit. His face was motionless and set, with
a peculiar absence of placidity&mdash;like a graven
image with topaz eyes. To Margaret it suggested
a figure on an Egyptian bas-relief, and
yet he looked much the same, she thought, as he
had ten years before. Perhaps his beard was
grayer and he was more stoop-shouldered, and&mdash;yes,
his temples looked somehow hollower and
older. He had a way of pausing just before the
closing word of a question, giving it a quaint
and unnatural emphasis, and of gazing above and
past one when he spoke or answered. When he
had first greeted her on her arrival, Margaret had
turned instinctively in the belief that he had
spoken to some one unperceived behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go in to&mdash;Lydia?&#8221; he said, difficultly.
&#8220;I think she wants you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Margaret came down the stairway a moment
later, tying the ribbons of her broad hat
under her chin, his look of inquiry met her at the
door, and the tinge of eagerness in his lack-lustre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
eyes faded back into stolidity again as she
told him it was only an errand for Lydia.</p>

<p>She jumped from the piazza and raced around
the drive toward the stables. Creed, the coachman,
whose wool was growing gray in a lifetime
of allegiance to the Whiting stock, was standing
by the window, holding a harvest apple for the
black, reaching lip and white, impatient teeth of
his favorite charge inside the stall. He dropped
his currycomb as he saw her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Miss Marg&#8217;et. Want me fur
sump&#8217;n?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I only came for Mrs. Drennen to see how
Sempire&#8217;s foot is. She says he stepped on a
stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black face puckered with a puzzled look,
that broadened into a smile the next instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marse Drennen done tole dat to Miss Liddy ez
a skuse fo&#8217; he not ridin&#8217; mo&#8217;. She all de time
tryin&#8217; to mek he git out an&#8217; gallavant. He ain&#8217;t

dat way, an&#8217; he jes humor her to think he do &#8217;em,
an&#8217; she nuver know no diffunce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had seated herself on the step and
was looking up. &#8220;You&#8217;ve always been with her,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Creed smiled to the limit of his heavy lips.
&#8220;&#8217;Deed I hev. When Miss Liddy wuz married
she purty nigh fou&#8217;t to fotch me wid her. Her
ole maid sister, she wantter keep me wid dee all
back dar in New O&#8217;leens. You see I knowed
Miss Liddy when she warn&#8217;t a hour ole an&#8217; no

<p>&#8220;Meh mammy wuz nussin&#8217; de li&#8217;l mite in her

she growed up lak she started, too. Marse Drennen
he proud lak a peacock when he come down
dyar frum de Norf an&#8217; cyared her off wid he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember how pretty she was.&#8221; Margaret
spoke softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does yo&#8217; sho &#8217;nuff? She wuz jes &#8217;bout yo&#8217;

wuz strong as a saplin&#8217;, an&#8217; she walk high lak a
hoss whut done tuck de blue ribbon et de fa&#8217;r.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sempire arched his shining neck and whinnied
gently for another apple. Creed stroked the intelligent
face affectionately. &#8220;Whut mek yo&#8217; go
juckin&#8217; dat way?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cyarn&#8217;t you see I&#8217;se
talkin&#8217; to de ledy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked into the fresh young face beneath
the straw hat with its nodding poppies and drew
a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;It do hurt me, honey, to see de change! Don&#8217;t
keer how hard I wucks, I feels lonesome to see
how de laugh an&#8217; song done died in her froat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Margaret arose from the step as he paused
and turned his dusky face away to pick up the
fallen currycomb.</p>

<p>As she walked back to the house Melwin&#8217;s figure
as she had seen him on the porch rose before
her memory&mdash;the face of a sleeper, with the look
of another man in another life. Before her misty
eyes it hung like a suspended mask against the
background of the drab stone walls.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VI.</h2></div>


<p>The frost scouts of the marshalling winter had
fallen upon the woods which skirted the Drennen
estate, and the great beeches were crimsoning in
their death flush; the maples enchanting with
their fickle foliage, some still clinging to their
green, and others brilliant with blushes that they
must soon stand naked before the cold stare of
the sky. Here and there on some aspiring knoll
a slim poplar rose like a splendid bouquet of
starting yellow.</p>

<p>At a turn of the road, which wound leisurely
between seamed tree-boles, Margaret had seated
herself upon a lichened slab of stone. Her
loosely braided hair lay against the hood of her
scarlet cloak, slipping from her shoulders, and
she seemed, in her vivid beauty, the incarnate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
spirit of the blazonry of fall. Her head was bare
and her clasped hands, dropped between her
knees, held a slender book, a random selection
from the litter of the library table. It was the
story of Marpessa, and unconsciously she had
folded down the leaf at the lines she had just
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="indent3">&#8220;I love thee then</div>
<div class="verse">Not only for thy body packed with sweet</div>
<div class="verse">Of all this world, that cup of brimming June,</div>
<div class="verse">That jar of violet wine set in the air,</div>
<div class="verse">That palest rose, sweet in the night of life;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor for that stirring bosom all besieged</div>
<div class="verse">By drowsing lovers, or thy perilous hair;</div>

<div class="verse">Not for this only do I love thee, but</div>
<div class="verse">Because Infinity upon thee broods,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou art full of whispers and of shadows.</div>
<div class="verse">Thou meanest what the sea has striven to say</div>
<div class="verse">So long, and yearnèd up the cliffs to tell;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art what all the winds have uttered not,</div>
<div class="verse">What the still night suggesteth to the heart.</div>
<div class="verse">Thy voice is like to music heard ere birth,</div>
<div class="verse">Some spirit lute touched on a spirit sea;</div>
<div class="verse">Thy face remembered is from other worlds;</div>
<div class="verse">It has been died for, though I know not when,</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

<div class="verse">It has been sung of, though I know not where.</div>
<div class="verse">It has the strangeness of the luring West,</div>
<div class="verse">And of sad sea-horizons; beside thee</div>
<div class="verse">I am aware of other times and lands,</div>
<div class="verse">Of birth far back, of lives in many stars.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>With the broadening half-smile upon her
parted lips and that far splendor in her eyes, she
looked as might have looked the earthly maiden
for whom the fair god and the passionate human
Idas pledged their loves before great Zeus.</p>

<p>The deadened trampling of horse&#8217;s hoofs upon
the soft, shaly road beat in upon her reverie. The
horse, moving briskly, was abreast of her as she
started to her feet. There was a sharp, surprised
exclamation from the rider, a snort of fear from
the animal as he shied and plunged sideways
from the flaring apparition. Almost before she
could cry out&mdash;so quickly that she could never
afterward recall how it happened&mdash;the thing was
done. The frantic brute reared white-eyed, rose
and pawed, wheeling, and the rider, with one
foot caught and dragging from the stirrup-iron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was down upon the ground. Margaret, without
reflection, acted instantly. With a single bending
spring of her lithe body she was beside the
creature&#8217;s head, her slender arms, like stripped
willow branches, straining and tugging at his
bit, until the steel clamps cut into her flesh. She
threw all the power of her arm upon the heavy
jaw, and with one hand reached and clasped
tight just above the great steaming, flame-notched
nostrils. The fierce head shook from
side to side an instant, then the lifting hoofs became
calm, and he stood still, trembling. Slipping
her hand to the bridle, she turned her head
for the first time and was face to face with
Daunt.</p>

<p>She gazed at him speechless, with widening
eyes. A leaping joy at the sight of him mixed
itself with a realization of his past peril. She
felt her face whiten under his steadfast gaze. A
thousand times she had imagined how they
might meet, what she might say, how she would
act, and now, without a breath of warning, Fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had set him there beside her. His hand lay next
hers upon the rein of the animal, which a single
faltering of her finger, a drooping of her eyelash
would have left to drag him helpless to a terrible
death. A breathless thanksgiving was in her
soul that she had not swerved in foot or hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly she noticed that his left hand hung
limp, and her whole being flamed into sympathy.
&#8220;Oh, your poor wrist! You have hurt it!&#8221; Her
fingers drew his arm up to her sight. Her look
caressed his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he said hastily, but with compressed
lips. &#8220;I must have wrenched it when I
tumbled. How awkward of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was I who frightened your horse; and no
wonder, when I jumped up right under his feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in that cloak, too!&#8221; he said, his eye
noting the buoyancy of her beauty and its grace
of curve.</p>

<p>The rebellious waves of her brown hair had
filched rosy lustres from her garb, and the blood
painted her cheeks with a stain like wild moss-berries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Her eyes chained his own. She had not
yet released his hand, but was touching it with
the purring regard of a woman for an injured
pet. The allurement of her physical charm
seemed to him to pass from her finger-tips like
pricklings of electricity from a Leyden jar.</p>

<p>Daunt shook off her hand with an uncontrollable
gesture, and with his one arm still thrust
through the bridle, drew her close to him and
kissed her&mdash;kissed her hair, her forehead, her
half-opened eyes, her mouth, her throat, her neck.</p>

<p>She felt his lips scorch through her cloak. He
dropped upon his knees, still holding her, and
showered kisses upon the rough folds of her
gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you know why I have
come! You know what I want! I want you!
Forgive me, but I couldn&#8217;t stay away. Do you
suppose I thought you meant what you said in
those letters? Why should you run away from
me? Why did you leave me as you did? What
is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>As he looked up at her, he saw that the light
had died out of her eyes. Her lips were trembling.
Her face was marked by lines of weariness.
She repulsed him gently and went back a
few steps, gazing at him sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have come,&#8221; she said then.
&#8220;You ought to have stayed away! You make it
so hard for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard?&#8221; His voice rose a little. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
love me? Have you quit caring for me? Is
that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that I will
give you up, then? You can&#8217;t love a man one day
and not love him the next! You&#8217;re not that sort!
Do you think I would have written you&mdash;do you
think for one minute I would have come here, if
I hadn&#8217;t known you loved me? What <i>is</i> this
thing that has come between us? What <i>is</i> it
takes you from me? Doesn&#8217;t love mean anything?
Tell me!&#8221; he said, as she was silent.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand there that way!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;How can I?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I tried to tell you in
those letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Letters!&#8221; There was a rasp in Daunt&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;What did they tell me? Only that there was
some occult reason&mdash;Heaven only knows what&mdash;why
it was all over; why I was not to see you
again. Do you suppose that&#8217;s enough for me?
You don&#8217;t know me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I know myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I know you better than you know
yourself. You said you didn&#8217;t want to see me
again! That was a lie! You <i>do</i> want to see me
again! You&#8217;re nursing some foolish self-deception.
You&#8217;re fighting your own instincts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fighting myself,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I&#8217;m fighting
what is weak and miserably wrong. I can&#8217;t explain
it to you. It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t know what
you think. I don&#8217;t know where I stand with myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You loved me!&#8221; he burst forth, in a tone almost
of rage. &#8220;You <i>loved</i> me! You know you
did! Great God! you don&#8217;t want me to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
you didn&#8217;t love me that day, do you?&#8221; he said, a
curiously hard expression coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She spoke wearily. &#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know.
How <i>can</i> I know? Don&#8217;t you see, it
isn&#8217;t what I thought then&mdash;it isn&#8217;t what I did. It&#8217;s
what was biggest in my thought. Oh&mdash;&#8221; she
broke off, &#8220;you can&#8217;t understand! You <i>can&#8217;t</i>!
It&#8217;s no use. You&#8217;re not a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said roughly, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a woman. I&#8217;m
only a man, and a man feels!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you think that of me,&#8221; she said
humbly. &#8220;But, indeed, indeed, I don&#8217;t mean to
be cruel&mdash;only to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not!&#8221; retorted Daunt bitterly.
&#8220;Women never mean things! Why should they?
They leave that to men! Do you suppose,&#8221; he
said with quick fierceness, &#8220;that there is anything
left in life for me? Is it that I&#8217;ve fallen in your
estimation? You thought I was strong, perhaps,
and now you have come to the conclusion that
I&#8217;m weak! And the fact that it was <i>you</i> and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<i>you</i> felt too makes no difference. I&#8217;ve heard of
women like that, but I never believed there were
any! You wash your feeling entirely out of your
conscience, and I&#8217;m the one who must hang for
it. And in spite of it all, you&#8217;re human! Do you
think I don&#8217;t know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She put out her hands as if to ward off a tangible
blow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said weakly, &#8220;please
don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Does it hurt to speak
of it? Do you want to forget it? Do you think
I ever shall? I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s all I shall
have to remind me that once you had a heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no!&#8221; she cried vehemently. &#8220;You <i>must</i>
understand me better than that! Don&#8217;t you see
that I want to do what you say? Don&#8217;t you see
that my only way is to fight it? It is I who am
weak! Oh, it seems in the past month I have
learned so much! I am too wise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said; &#8220;can you say truly in your
heart that you do not love me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;That&mdash;isn&#8217;t it,&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; he flamed. &#8220;Tell me you don&#8217;t love me
and I will go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent, twisting up her fingers with a
still intensity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s so much in loving. It has so
many parts. We love so many ways. We have
more of us than our bodies. We have souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a disembodied spirit,&#8221; he broke in.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t love you with any sub-conscious essence.
I don&#8217;t believe in any isms. I love you with
every fibre of my body&mdash;with every beat of my
heart&mdash;with every nerve and with every thought
of my brain! I love you as every other man in
all the world loves every other woman in the
world. I&#8217;m human; and I&#8217;m wise enough to
know that God made us human with a purpose.
He knows better than all the priests in the world.
How do you <i>want</i> to be loved? I tell you I love
you with all&mdash;<i>all</i>&mdash;body and mind and soul!
Now do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s how I love
you. Oh, no; I don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how you love me!&#8221; he retorted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of that! You loved me enough
that once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just it! I forgot everything. I
forgot myself and you! I wanted the touch of
your hands&mdash;of your face! There was nothing
else in the whole world! Oh!&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;do
you think I thought of my soul then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he said, coming toward her so that
she could feel his hot breaths. &#8220;You&#8217;re morbid.
You&#8217;re unstrung. You have an idea that one
ought to love in some subtle, supernatural,
heavenly way. That&#8217;s absurd. We are made
with flesh-and-blood bodies. We have veins that
run and nerves that feel. You are trying to forget
that you have a heart. We are not intended
to be spirits&mdash;not until after we die, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we <i>have</i> spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but it&#8217;s only through our
hearts, through our mind&#8217;s hopes, through our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
affections, that we know it. All our soul&#8217;s nourishment
comes through the senses. That&#8217;s what
they were given us for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one must rule&mdash;one must be master.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daunt leaned toward her and caught both her
hands in his one. &#8220;Ardee, dear,&#8221; he said more
softly, &#8220;don&#8217;t push me off like this! Don&#8217;t resist
so! I love you&mdash;you know I do. This is only
some unheard-of experiment in emotion. Let it
go! There&#8217;s nothing in the world worth breaking
both our hearts for this way. There can&#8217;t be
any real reason! Come to me, dear! Come
back! Come back! Won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the softness of his tone her eyes had filled
slowly with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t! Oh, I mustn&#8217;t! The happiness
would turn into a curse. You mustn&#8217;t ask me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daunt struggled between a rising pity for her
suffering and a helpless frenzy of irritation. Between
the two he felt himself choking. There
seemed in her a resistance and an implacable hostility
that he was as powerless to combat as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
understand. He began to comprehend the terrible
strength that lies in consistent weakness.
There was something far worse in her silent
mood than there could have been in a storm of reproaches
or of vehement denial. He felt that if
he spoke again he could but raise higher the barrier
between them, which would not be beaten
down by sheer force. He mounted, stumblingly
and blindly, his left hand awkwardly swinging,
and, turning his horse&#8217;s head, spurred him into a
vicious trot.</p>

<p>A bit of golden-rod had dropped from his button-hole
when he had crushed her in his embrace,
and as he disappeared down the curved road,
under the passionate foliage, Margaret slipped
upon her knees and caught the dusty blossom to
her face in agonized abandon. Tears came to
her in a gusty whirl of longing, and strangling
sobs tore at her throat.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VII.</h2></div>


<p>Nightshade and wistaria. The lusty poison-vine
and the delicate climbing tendrils. The evil
and the pure. Their snake-like stems wound
about each other, twining in sinuous intimacy,
the cardinal berries flaunting alone where the
fragrant purple blooms had long since fallen.
They clung to each other, the enmeshed and alien
branches veiling a sightless trunk, whose rotted
limbs, barkless and neglected, projected bare
knobs complainingly from the vagrant tangle. It
drew Margaret&#8217;s steps, and she went closer. The
dogs that had followed yelping at her heels, after
she had tired of throwing sticks for them to
fetch, now went nosing off across the orchard in
canine unsympathy with her reflective mood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
She stood a monochrome, in roughish brown
tweed, under the dappling shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Langdon, I believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>The deep, resonant voice recalled her. She
saw a smooth-shaven face with the rounded outline
that belongs to youth, and is but rarely the
heritage of age, surmounted by the striking incongruity
of perfectly milk-white hair. His lips
were thin and firm, suggesting at one time
strength and firmness, and the glance which met
her from the frank, hazel eyes was one of open
friendliness. His clerical coat was close-buttoned
to his vigorous chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Dr. Craig,&#8221; he said, &#8220;rector of Trinity
parish. I heard that Mrs. Drennen had a cousin
visiting her, and I came out to ask you to come to
our Sabbath services. We haven&#8217;t as ambitious a
choir, perhaps, as you have in your city church,&#8221;
he said, smiling, &#8220;&mdash;though we have one tenor
voice which I think quite remarkable&mdash;but we
offer the same message and just as warm a welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Her loneliness had wanted just such a greeting.
&#8220;I shall be glad to come!&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I passed the church only yesterday and sat
awhile in the porch to rest. It is so peaceful, set
among the trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seemed entirely out of the world as I
walked up the path,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I could almost
see you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking at this.&#8221; She pointed to the
clustering vines.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an audacious climber! Its berries have
the color of rubies. And a wistaria, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking when you came,&#8221; she continued
hesitatingly, &#8220;what a pity it was that the
two should have ever grown together. The wistaria
has an odor like far-away incense, and its
leaves are tender and delicate-veined, like a
climbing soul. The nightshade is dark green and
its berries are sin-color. They don&#8217;t belong together,
and now nobody in the world could ever
pull them apart without killing them both. Isn&#8217;t
it a pity?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, there is where I think you err! That bold,
aspiring sap is just what the pallid wistaria
needs. Its perfume is less insipid for the mingling
earth-smell of the other. It climbs higher
and reaches further for the other&#8217;s strength.
The flora of nature follows the same great law as
humanity. Opposite elements combine to make
the strongest men and women. One of the most
valuable, I think, of the suggestions we get from
the vegetable creation is the thought of its comprehensive
good. Nothing that is useful is bad,
and there is nothing that has not its use. What
we know is, the higher grows and develops by
means of the lower.&#8221; His fine face lifted as he
spoke with conscious dignity.</p>

<p>To Margaret, in the untiring challenge of her
self-questionings, his view brought an unworded
solace. Her mind grasped eagerly at his thought,
puzzled by itself, yet reaching for the visible
spirituality of the man. His face, calm and with
a tinge of almost priestly asceticism, was a tacit
reassurance. A wish to hear him speak, to talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to him, came to her. He had lived longer than
she, he knew so much more! If she could only
ask him! If she only knew how to begin! If
some instinct could only whisper to his mind&#8217;s
ear the benumbing question her whole being battled
with, without her having to put it into
words! Even if she could&mdash;even if he could
guess it&mdash;he might misunderstand. No girl ever
had such thoughts before! They were only hers&mdash;only
hers, to hide, to bury in silence! She
blushed hotly to think that she had ever thought
of voicing it to the air. A guilty horror, lest her
face might betray what she was thinking, bathed
her. She could never, never tell it! There could
be no help from outside. Her mind must struggle
with it alone.</p>

<p>She started visibly, with a feeling that she had
been overheard, at a crunching step behind them.
Her companion greeted the arrival with the
heartiness of an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Condy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;much obliged for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
salve of yours. It has quite made a new dog
of Birdo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet so?&#8221; inquired the newcomer, with interest.
&#8220;Et&#8217;s a powerful good salve.&#8221; His
straggling yellow beard and much-battered straw
hat shed a mellow lustre on his leathery, sun-tanned
face, where twinkled clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve jest been up by th&#8217; kennels,&#8221; he volunteered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you found the family all well?&#8221; the
rector inquired, with gravely humorous concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toler&#8217;ble. Th&#8217; ole mastiff won&#8217;t let me git
clost &#8217;nough t&#8217; say more&#8217;n howdy do. He&#8217;s wuss
&#8217;n a new town marshal!&#8221; He rasped a sulphur
match against his trouser-leg and lit his short
clay pipe, hanging his head awkwardly to do so,
and disclosing the inquisitive muzzle and beady
eyes of a diminutive setter pup, which he carried
under his butternut coat, supported in his forearm.
Margaret patted the cold nose, and its
owner displayed it pridefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t but three weeks old,&#8221; he said, &#8220;en&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I&#8217;m a-bringin&#8217; him up on th&#8217; bottle. Ef I fetch
him eround he&#8217;ll make a fine setter one o&#8217; these
days, fer he&#8217;s got good points. Look at th&#8217; shape
o&#8217; his toes! Et goes agin my grain t&#8217; lose a
puppy. Somehow et seems ez ef they hev ez
much right t&#8217; live ez some other people.&#8221; His
mouth relaxed broadly about his pipe-stem, with
a damp smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221; asked the rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest ailin&#8217;, puny like. Dogs ez a lot like
babies; some on &#8217;em could be littered en&#8217; grow up
in a snowdrift, en&#8217; others could be born in a
straw kennel en&#8217; die ef you look at &#8217;em. This one
was so weakly thet Bess, my ole setter, wouldn&#8217;t
look at him. Jest poked him eround with her
nose, poor little devil! en&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t give him ez
much ez a lick. Et&#8217;s a funny thing,&#8221; he continued,
stuffing down the embers in his pipe with
a hard forefinger, &#8220;th&#8217; difference there ez thet
way between dogs en&#8217; folks. I never seen a
woman yit thet wouldn&#8217;t take all kinds o&#8217; keer fer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a sick baby, but a dog puts all her nussin&#8217; on her
healthy young uns en&#8217; lets th&#8217; ailin&#8217; shift fer theirselves.
Mebbe et&#8217;s because she hez so many all at
once, but I guess it&#8217;d be the same with women ef
they hed a dozen at once ez et ez now. The parson
here&#8221;&mdash;he blinked at Margaret with a suspicion
of levity&mdash;&#8220;says ez how et&#8217;s because th&#8217;
dogs ain&#8217;t got no souls. I don&#8217;t know how thet
ez, but et looks ez ef et might be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rector laughed good-humoredly as the decreasing
figure silhouetted itself against the field.
&#8220;Condy&#8217;s a unique character,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but immensely
likable. He has a quaint philosophy
that isn&#8217;t down in the books, but it&#8217;s none the less
interesting for that. I must be going now,&#8221; he
continued; &#8220;sermons in stones and books in running
brooks won&#8217;t do for my congregation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will go up to the house and see Lydia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already seen her. She told me I should
find you somewhere in the fields, she thought.
Your cousin is a great sufferer,&#8221; he added gently.
&#8220;She is a beautiful character&mdash;uncomplaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
under a most grievous affliction. I am deeply
sorry for her, and yet&#8221;&mdash;there was a note of perplexity
in his voice&mdash;&#8220;sometimes I believe I pity
her husband even more! I am not well acquainted
with him personally. I wish I might
know him better. She often speaks to me of him.
Her love for him is most exquisite; it always reminds
me of the perfume of the night-blooming-cereus.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his leave of Margaret with grave
courtesy and left her standing on the leaf-littered
grass, with the red berries of the nightshade
gleaming through the rank green foliage above
her head.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VIII.</h2></div>


<p>Lydia&#8217;s reclining chair had been rolled close to
the window and Margaret sat beside her, contemplating
a melancholy drizzle, mingled with
sweeping gusts of rain. The chickens stood in
huddled groups under the garden shrubs, and the
white and yellow chrysanthemums, from their
long, bordering beds, shook out their frowsy
petals and drank rejoicingly. Margaret loved to
watch the splash of the shower upon the fallen
leaves. Her nature reflected no neutral tints;
rain and gray weather to her had never been
coupled with sadness.</p>

<p>The emaciated hands by her side moved restlessly
in the afghan. &#8220;What a bad day for Mell,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;He is fond of the saddle, and now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
will come home wet and cold, before his ride is
half finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret looked at her curiously. She recalled
Sempire&#8217;s stone-bruise and Creed&#8217;s version
of it. Melwin she had left only a few
minutes before, sitting statue-like in the library,
with his chin upon his hands. She felt with a
smarting of her eyelids that the pathetic deception
was but a part of the consideration, the tender,
watching guard with which he surrounded
the invalid&#8217;s every thoughtfulness of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; Lydia spoke almost appealingly,
laying a hand upon her arm, &#8220;do you think Mell
seemed happy to-day? You remember him when
we were married? I&#8217;ve seen him toss you many
a time, as a little girl, on his shoulder. Don&#8217;t
you remember how he used to laugh when he
would pretend to let you fall over backward?
Does he seem to you to be any different now?
Not older&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that (of course he is
some older)&mdash;but soberer. He used to have
friends out from the city, and be always bird-hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
or playing polo. I could go with him
then; he liked to have me. He used to say he
wanted to show me off. He seems to be so much
more alone now, and to care less for such things.
At first it made me happy to think that he
couldn&#8217;t enjoy them any longer when I couldn&#8217;t
share them with him. That was very selfish, I
know, and now his not taking pleasure in them
is a pain to me. I want him to. He is so good to
me! It seems sometimes as if I were a reproach
to him. I am so helpless, useless&mdash;such a hindering
burden. I can&#8217;t do anything but go on loving
him. If I could only help him! If I could
dust his desk, or fill his pipe, or tend the primroses
he loves, or put the buttons in his shirts for
him, or do any one of the thousand little foolish
things that a woman loves to do for her husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching over, Margaret patted her hand
gently. The patient eyes looked up at her hungrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Margaret, if I could only know that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was happy! If I could only fill his life wholly,
completely, to the brim! I feel so bodiless lying
here. Other women must mean so much more to
their husbands. I used to pray to die&mdash;to be
taken away from him. I thought that he would
love me better dead. Love doesn&#8217;t die that way&mdash;it&#8217;s
living that kills love. And I couldn&#8217;t bear
to think that I might live to see it die slowly, horribly,
little by little; and I watched, oh, so jealously!
for the first sign. It&#8217;s a dreadful thing to
be jealous of life! I have thought that if it could
be right for him to marry another woman while
I was still his wife&mdash;one who could give him all
I lack&mdash;that I would even be content, if he were
only happy! There is just my mind left now for
him to love, and the mind, so denied, rusts
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your <i>soul</i> is alive,&#8221; said Margaret softly,
&#8220;and that is what we love and love with. It
seems to me that the most beautiful thing in the
world is a love like Melwin&#8217;s for you&mdash;one that is
all spirit. It is like the love of a child for a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
star, that is not old and dusty like the earth, but
pure and shining and very, very far above its
head. When I was little I used to have one particular
star that I called my own. I wouldn&#8217;t
have been happier to have touched it or to have
had it any nearer. I was contented just to look
up to it and love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a genuine comforter!&#8221; said Lydia, a
smile of something more nearly approaching joy
than Margaret had yet seen there playing upon
her lips. &#8220;I am ungrateful. It is wicked of me
to repine as I do! God has given me Mell&#8217;s love,
and every day it winds closer around me. And
he loves my soul. I ought to think how much
more blest I am than other women whose husbands
do not care for them! I ought to spend my
time thinking of him and not of myself! Perhaps
I could plan more little pleasures for him.
We used to make so many pretty surprises for
each other, and we got so much happiness out of
them. It is the small things in life that please
us most. When we were first married, I studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
all the little ways. I wore the colors he was fond
of, and did my hair as he thought was most becoming.
Why, I wouldn&#8217;t have put on a ribbon
or a flower that I thought he did not like! He
set so much store by those things. Do you see
that big closet on the other side of the room?
Open the door. There are all the dresses that
Mell liked me in when we were married. Do
you see that pearl liberty silk with the valenciennes?
I had that on the last night we ever
danced together&mdash;the night before I was hurt.
He liked me best of all in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed her hand caressingly over the shimmering
lengths which Margaret had spread out
across her knees. &#8220;You would look well in such
a gown,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your hair is like mine was,
only a shade darker. Put the skirt on. There!
It fits you, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>A stir of anticipation, of excitement, overspread
her languor. &#8220;I want you to do me a
favor; I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ll mind! Take dinner
to-night with Melwin downstairs. I am tired to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and I shall go to sleep early. Wear the dress;
maybe it will remind him of the way I looked
then, when I had the same roses in my cheeks.
He called them holly berries. Will you wear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret turned away under pretense of examining
the yellow lace. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and I have a cameo pin that will just suit to
clasp it at the throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Lydia had half raised herself on
her elbow. &#8220;In my box on the dresser is a string
of pearls. Mell gave me them to go with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the ornament and, with an exclamation
of delight, unfastened the neck of her nightgown
and clasped it around her throat. Dropping
her chin to see how the lustreless spheres
drooped across the pitiful hollows of her neck,
she gave them back with a sigh that was sadder
than any words and turned her head wearily on
the pillow.</p>

<p>Margaret gathered up the garments tenderly,
and bent over and left a light kiss on the faded
cheek as she went from the room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IX.</h2></div>


<p>Margaret stood before the cheval-glass in
Lydia&#8217;s gown, smiling at the quaint reflection.
It showed a figure with slim, pointed waist between
billowy paniers, flounced with Spanish
frill after the fashion of a decade before. The
neck was square-cut and the tight sleeves reached
to the elbow, ending in a fall of lace. It was
not unbecoming to her. Her brown eyes had borrowed
from the pearl tint a misty violet and the
springing growth of her hair had taken on the
shade of wet broom-straw. A faint glow rose
in her cheeks as she surveyed her own stirring
image. She clasped the close necklace of pearls
about her throat. Poor Lydia! Something as
fair she must have looked in that old time so
rudely ended! Poor Melwin!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>The wide dining-room doors stood open, and
she did not pause, but went directly in. The old
butler stood in the hall, and she noticed wonderingly
that he gazed at her with a scared expression
and moved backward, his arms stretched behind
him in an instinctive gesture of fright which
puzzled her. Were even the ancient servitors of
the house as incomprehensible as was their
master?</p>

<p>Melwin stood leaning against the polished rosewood
sideboard, his unseeing gaze fixed on a
glass-prismed candelabra of antique workmanship,
whose pendants vibrated ceaselessly. His
lifted stare, which went beyond, suddenly caught
and fastened itself upon her in a look of startled
fascination. His lean fingers gripped the edge
of the wood and he stiffened all over like a wild
animal couched to spring. His shrunken features
were marked with a convulsion of fearful
anguish. Margaret shrank back dismayed at the
lambent fire that had leaped into his colorless
eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;Lydia!&#8221; The cry burst from his lips as he
made a quick step toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Melwin!&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;what is the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The table was between them, but she could
see that he was shaking. His eyes turned from
her to the opposite wall, then back again. Her
gaze followed his and rested upon a splendid full-length
portrait. She knew at once that it was
Lydia. But she saw in that one instant more
than this; she saw her own face, radiant, sparkling,
the same lightened, straw-tinted hair, the
same shadowy violet eyes, the same gown, pearl
gray, quaintly cut, that had faced her in the
depths of the cheval-glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melwin, don&#8217;t you know me? Why, it&#8217;s I&mdash;Margaret!&#8221;</p>

<p>His lips lifted from his teeth. Even through
the strained agony of his face, she could have
imagined him about to laugh. It seemed a minute
before his voice came, and when it did it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
scourged her like a sting of a lash. She cringed
under its livid fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you? How <i>dare</i> you come to me
like that? Do you think a man is a stone? Do
you think he has no feeling, that you can torture
him like this? Do you think he never remembers
or suffers? Is there nothing in his past
that&#8217;s too sacred to lay hands upon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Lydia, Melwin,&#8221; cried Margaret, her
fingers wandering stumblingly along the low
neck of the gown; &#8220;she asked me to do it. She
thought it would please you. She thought it
would remind you of the way she used to look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told you?&#8221; A softer expression came to
his face. The hard lines fell away; the weary
ghost of an unborn smile hovered on his lips,
trembling and pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care! Please, please don&#8217;t look so! I
didn&#8217;t think! I will go away at once and take
the dress off.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his arms upon the back of a chair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
dropped his head upon them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me,
child,&#8221; he said brokenly; &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t help it.
You didn&#8217;t understand. When a man&#8217;s flesh has
been bruised with pincers, when his sinews have
been wrenched and dragged as mine have, he
does not take kindly to the rack. You could
have wrung my heart out of my body to-night
with your hands, and it would not have hurt so
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry!&#8221; Margaret breathed, warm
gushes of pity sweeping over her. &#8220;You could
never guess how sorry I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said more calmly, &#8220;that I have
been a puzzle to you. You were too young to
know me when I <i>lived</i>. I am only half alive
now. Life has gone by and left me stranded.
Look at that picture, child. That was Lydia&mdash;the
Lydia of the best years of my life&mdash;the Lydia
that I loved and won and married! Twelve
years! How long ago it seems!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had seated herself opposite him and
leaned forward, her bare elbows on the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
her locked fingers against her cheek. &#8220;I&mdash;understand
now.&#8221; Her voice was a strenuous
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will know what that is some time&mdash;to feel
one nearer than all the world&mdash;to tremble when
her arm presses yours, to listen for the swish of
her skirt, to turn hot and cold at the smell of her
hair or the touch of her lips! She was beautiful&mdash;more
beautiful to me than any woman I had
ever seen, or ever shall see. She filled every corner
of me! Life was complete. It had nothing
left to give me. Can you think what that means?
You know what happened then. It came crashing
in upon my youth like a falling tower. Since
then the years have gone by, but they stopped
for me that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>An intenser look was in Margaret&#8217;s eyes.
&#8220;But you have Lydia&mdash;you love her!&#8221;</p>

<p>He breathed sharply. &#8220;Have her!&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;I have her mind, her soul, the intellect
that answered mine, the soul that leaned to my
soul, but <i>her</i>&mdash;<i>her</i>&mdash;the body I held, the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I caressed, the fragrant life I touched&mdash;where
is it? Where? I love her!&#8221; he cried with abrupt
passion. &#8220;I loved her then; I love her now.
I have never loved another woman! I never think
a thought that is not of her. My very dreams, my
imagination are hers! I would rather die than
love another woman!</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose people pity me and think how hard
it was that Lydia&#8217;s accident couldn&#8217;t have happened
before we were married instead of afterward.
Fools! <i>Fools!</i> As though that would
make it different! If it must have been, I
wouldn&#8217;t have it otherwise. Not to possess
wholly the woman one loves is the cruelty of
Love; the pain of knowing that no other love
can possess you is the mercy of Love. Such
misery is dearer than all other joys. She is <i>mine</i>,
and with every breath that I curse Fate with I
thank God for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that happiness?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed, a short, jarring, mirthless laugh
that hurt her. &#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that is all a man craves? Can a man&mdash;a living,
breathing man&mdash;live on soul alone? Can you
feed a starving human being on philosophy?
His stomach cries for bread! You can quench
his spiritual thirst while his heart dries up with
physical drought. He wants both sides. With
one unsatisfied, he goes halting, crippled. I live
in my past and feed on the husks of it. Do you
think they fill me? I tell you, I go always
hungry&mdash;always famishing for what other men
have!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret felt as if she were being wafted
through some intangible inferno of suffering.
She felt smothered, as by the dust of some dead
thing into whose open grave she had unwittingly
stumbled. The real Melwin that she had waked
terrified her. The glimpse through the torn
mask, into the distorted face, with its marks of
branding, shook the depths of her nature. She
had always thought of Melwin abstractly, as of a
beautiful personality, crowned with spiritual
stars and haloed with pain; now she saw him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he was&mdash;a half-man, decrepit, moribund, his passion
no living glow, but a flitting and unreal fox-fire,
which he must follow, follow, grasping at,
but never gaining. The dreadful unfulfilment of
his life&#8217;s promise sat upon his brow and cried to
her from every word and gesture. She felt as if
she was gazing at some mysterious and but half-indicated
problem to which there could be no
answer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was a meal which Margaret never afterward
remembered without a recoil. A chilling
self-consciousness had fallen upon her and clogged
her tongue. Melwin ate hastily and almost
fiercely, saying nothing, and once half rising, it
seemed in utter forgetfulness of her presence,
and then sitting down again. She excused herself
before the coffee and slipped away, running
hastily up the stair to her room, her feet catching
in the unaccustomed tightness of the old-fashioned
skirt.</p>

<p>As she turned the key in the lock, she fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
she heard a moan through the thick walls of
Lydia&#8217;s room, and she tore off the garments with
feverish haste, shutting them from her sight in
the carved Dutch chest which filled one corner,
releasing, as she did so, a pungent odor of cedar;
not the fresh, resinous smell of sappy forest-growth,
but the dead-faint aroma of the past&mdash;the
perfume that belonged to Lydia&#8217;s gown, to
Melwin, and to that gloomy house and all it contained.</p>

<p>She pushed open the heavy blinds and leaned
across the window ledge, questioning. Melwin
was a man&mdash;but Lydia? Had she also this inner
buried side, which in him had been shocked into
betrayal? Were men and women alike? Were
their longings and cravings the same? Was
there something in the one which felt and answered
the every need of the other? Was spiritual
attraction forever dependent for its completion
upon physical love? The thought came to
her that in the long years Melwin had become less
himself; that his brooding mind had perhaps lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
its balance; that what to a healthier mind would
be but a shadow had grown for him a threatening
phantom. Her heart was full of a vague protest
against the suggestion which had thrust itself
upon her.</p>

<p>Her spiritual side reached out groping hands
for comfort and sustenance.</p>

<p>Drawing down the window, she turned into the
room. A ponderous Bible in huge blocked leathern
covers lay on the low table, its antiquated
silver clasps winking in the light from the
pronged candlestick. With a sudden impulse,
she threw it open, leaning forward, her fingers
nervously ruffling its edges. This was the soul-comforter
of the ages. It must help her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Hadad died also. And the dukes of Edom
were; duke Timnah, duke Aliah, duke Jetheth,</p>

<p>&#8220;Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pimon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The musty chronicle meant nothing. She
turned again, parting the leaves near to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household
of Onesiphorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus
have I left at Miletum sick.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She almost laughed at the banality of her haphazard
choice. She knew the pages full of condemnation
for the unworthy thought. Now they
mocked her. Impatiently she opened the huge
volume wide in the middle. A new and intense
eagerness illumed her face as her eyes rested
on the page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou
art fair; thou hast doves&#8217; eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise
up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>

<p>&#8220;By night on my bed I sought him whom my
soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him
not.</p>

<p>&#8220;My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest
among ten thousand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&#8220;His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are
bushy, and black as a raven.</p>

<p>&#8220;His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers
of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</p>

<p>&#8220;His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet
flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet-smelling
myrrh.* * *</p>

<p>&#8220;His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether
lovely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She looked up startled, her breath struggling
in her breast; a deep, vivid blush spread over her
face and neck, glowing crimson against the
whiteness of her apparel.</p>

<p>The room seemed suddenly dense with a dank,
spicy smell of roses mixed with salty wind. It
spread from the pages of the book and hung
wreathing about her till the air was filled with
fiery flowers. She felt herself burning hot, as if
a flame were scorching her flesh. In the emptiness
of the room, she caught her hands to her
cheeks shamedly, lest the world could see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tell-tale color. Even the dim candles&#8217; light
angered her, and she blew them out, creeping into
the soft bed hastily, as though into a hiding-place.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">X.</h2></div>


<p>For some days after her unforgettable meeting
with Daunt in the woods, Margaret had not left
the house. She had spent much of her time
reading to Lydia. There was a never lessening
sorrow in the invalid&#8217;s gaze that affected her,
full as was her mind of her own thoughts, and
she had been glad to sit with her to escape the
slow-burning fires that haunted her in Melwin&#8217;s
opaque eyes.</p>

<p>She had almost a fear to venture beyond the
shelter of this cheerless home&mdash;a fear of what
she longed for unspeakably and as unspeakably
dreaded. She told herself that Daunt was gone,
that he had returned to the city, that she would
not see him again at Warne. And yet her inmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
wish belied the thought. He had gone away
believing her cruel. The memory tortured her.
An instinctive modesty, as innate as her conscience,
had made it impossible for her to express
in words the distinction which her own sensitiveness
had drawn. To think of it was an intangible
agony; to voice it was to penetrate the
veiled sanctuary of her woman-soul.</p>

<p>But the afternoon following Melwin&#8217;s outburst
in the dining-room, her flagging spirits and the
smell of the cropped fields drew her out of doors.
She was sore with a sense of reproach at her own
unthinking blunder. Since then she had not seen
Melwin. She felt how awkward would be the
next meeting.</p>

<p>The sunlight splintered against low-sailing
clumps of vapor which extended to the horizon,
and the chill of the air prompted her to walk
briskly. She did not take the wood road, but
kept to the open country, following the maple-lined
footpath that boarded the rusting hedgerows.
There was little promise in the drooping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
despondent sky. A shiver of wind was in the
tall grasses and a far whistling of a flock of
marsh-birds came to her over the moist fallow.</p>

<p>A darting chipmunk made her turn her head,
and she became conscious that a figure was close
behind her. An intuitive knowledge flashed
upon her that it was Daunt. A vibrant thrill
shot through her limbs and she felt her cheeks
heating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret! Margaret!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her head where he stood uncovered
behind her. His left wrist was bound tightly
with a black band, and he carried his arm thrust
between the buttons of his jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am disabled for riding, you see,&#8221; he said,
smiling. &#8220;My wrist has gone lame on me. You
see I am stopping at Tenbridge, and I walked
over the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ease and naturalness of his opening disarmed
her. She caught herself smiling back at
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry about your wrist,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Does it pain you much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only when I forget and use it. Did you
think I would come back again?&#8221; This with
blunt directness.</p>

<p>She made him no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, I have been here every day
since I saw you. I&#8217;ve spent the hours haunting
the road through the woods and tramping these
paths between the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not been out of the house since then,&#8221;
she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you afraid you might see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know I don&#8217;t
want to persecute you. If you will only tell me
truly that you don&#8217;t love me, I will go away at
once and never see you again. But I believe that
there is no other thing in life worth setting
against love. It means my happiness and yours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and it would be cowardly for me to give you up
for anything but your happiness. Can&#8217;t we reason
a little about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head hopelessly. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
help. I have reasoned and reasoned, and it only
makes me wretched.&#8221;</p>

<p>His brows knit perplexedly. He stopped and
faced her in the path. &#8220;Do you think that I have
come to you for any other reason than that I
want you, that you mean more to me now than
you ever did? That I love you more&mdash;<i>more</i>&mdash;since
I know you love me wholly? You have
loved me, absolutely. Now you are refusing to
marry me! Why? Why? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s flush had deepened. While he had
been speaking, she had several times flung out
her hand in mute protest. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;how
can I make you understand? Love is strange
and terrible. It isn&#8217;t enough to love with the
earth-side of us! Why&#8221;&mdash;her voice vibrated
with a little tremor&mdash;&#8220;I would love you just the
same if I knew you <i>had</i> no soul&mdash;if there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
only the human feel of you, and if I knew you
must die like a dumb beast and not go to my
heaven. If I knew that I should never see you
again after this life, I would love you and long
for you, just the same, now and afterward! Oh,
there must be something wrong with my soul!
That kind of a love is wrong. It&#8217;s the love of the
flesh! Don&#8217;t you see? Can&#8217;t you see it&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daunt struck savagely at the wiry beard-grasses
with the stick he carried. This doubt
was so irrational, so unwholesome to his healthy
mind that to argue it filled him with a dumb
anger. He groaned inwardly. She was impossible!</p>

<p>&#8220;You give no credit,&#8221; he slowly said at last,
&#8220;to your humanity. In a woman of your soul-sensitiveness,
it is unthinkable that the one
should exist without the other. Soul and sense
react upon each other. Bodily love, in people
who possess spirituality, who are not mere clods,
dependent upon their eyes and appetites for all
life gives them, presupposes spiritual affinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The physical may be the lesser side of us, but it
is not necessarily the lower. Whatever there is
in Nature is there because it ought to be. If we
cannot see its beauty or its meaning, let us not
blame Nature; let us blame ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;that I haven&#8217;t
thought all that! It is so easy to reason around
to what we <i>want</i> to believe. It doesn&#8217;t make me
happy to think as I do, but I can&#8217;t help it! We
can&#8217;t make ourselves <i>feel</i>. <i>I</i> can&#8217;t! What good
would it do me to make myself <i>think</i> I believed
that? You would soon see what I lacked, and I
would know it, and we would be chained to each
other while our souls shrivelled. Oh,&#8221; she
ended with almost a sob, &#8220;I am so utterly
miserable!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daunt felt a mad desire to take that near-by
form in his arms, to soothe her and comfort her.
He felt as if she were squeezing his heart small
with her hands. He was silent. Then his resentful
will rose in an ungovernable flood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I intend to break my life in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
two for a quibble&mdash;for a baseless fancy? I tell
you, you&#8217;re wrong! You&#8217;re wrong! You&#8217;ve
tangled yourself up in a lot of sophistry! Don&#8217;t
think I am going to give up. I won&#8217;t! You
shall come to yourself! You shall! You <i>shall</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret felt the leap of his will as an unbroken
pacer the unexpected flick of a whip-thong.
It was a new sensation. It had a tang
of mastery, of domination, that was strange to
her. She was unprepared for such a situation.
She looked at him half stealthily. In the lines of
his mouth there was an unfamiliar sovereignty.
She felt that deliciousness of revolt which every
strong woman feels at the first contact with an
overbearing masculinity. A swift suggestion of
the potentiality of his unyielding purpose stabbed
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the rain descended and the floods came
and the winds blew and beat upon that house;
and it fell: and great was the fall of it.&#8221; A
flitting memory brought the parable to her mind.
Could it be that the house of her defence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
built upon the sands? &#8220;And the rain descended
and the floods came and the winds blew&#8221;&mdash;the
first promise of the tempest was in his eyes. A
fear of yielding insinuated itself darkly. The
set intentness of his obstinacy lingered after his
words, hung about her in the air and pressed
upon her with the weight of an unescapable
necessity. Her breath strained her.</p>

<p>All at once she turned, speaking rapidly, incoherently.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t talk to me like that!
Don&#8217;t argue with me! I can&#8217;t bear it&mdash;now!
I&#8217;m all at sea; I&#8217;m a ship without a captain.
Don&#8217;t bend me; I was never made to be bent. I
have got to think for myself. You must go away&mdash;indeed,
you must! Somehow, to talk about it
makes it so much worse. I can&#8217;t discuss it!
Don&#8217;t ask me any more! Oh, I know you think
I&#8217;m unreasonable. It sounds unreasonable sometimes,
even to myself. I wish you wouldn&#8217;t
blame me, but I know you must. You can&#8217;t help
it. I blame myself, and I hurt myself, and the
blame and the want and the hurt are all mixed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
together! If you care&mdash;if you care anything for
me, you will go away! You won&#8217;t come again.
I hurt you when you do, and I can&#8217;t bear to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daunt nodded, took her hand, held it a moment,
and then released it. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said
quietly and sadly. He did not offer to kiss her.
The fire had died out of his voice and there was
left only a constrained sorrow. But it had no
note of despair. Its resignation was just as wilful
as had been its assertive passion. He looked at
her a moment lingeringly, then turned and vaulting
the hedge, with squared shoulders and swinging
stride, struck off across the stubble of the
fields.</p>

<p>Margaret did not look back, but she knew he
had not turned his head. Then a long sigh escaped
her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XI.</h2></div>


<p>Her blood coursed drummingly as she went
back along the road, half running, her hat fallen,
held by the loose ribbon under her chin, her hands
opening and closing nervously. Her head was
high and her mood struck through her like the
smell of turned earth to a wild thing of the jungle.
She wanted action, hard movement, and she ran
with fingers spread to feel the breeze. Her
thoughts were a tumult&mdash;her feelings one massing,
striving storm of voices, through which ran
constant, vibrating, a single, insistent, dominant
chord.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>shall</i>! You <small>SHALL</small>!&#8221; she repeated under
her breath. &#8220;Why do I like that? It&#8217;s sweeter
than bells! I can hear him say it yet. It was
like a hand, pulling me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>She stopped stock-still, suddenly, gazing at the
fallen purple-and-crimson autumn leaves, a
poured-out glory of color at her feet. &#8220;Splendid!&#8221;
she said. She bent and swept up a great
armful and tossed the clean, wispy, crackling
things in the air. They fell in a whirling shower
over her face, catching in her hair. In the midst
of them she laughed aloud, every chord of her
body sounding. Then, with a quick revulsion,
she threw out her arms and sank panting on the
selvage of the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do? What can I do?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid! I can&#8217;t go on fighting this way!
It&mdash;drags me so.&#8221; Her fingers were pulling up
the tapery grass-spears in a sinister terror. &#8220;I
felt so strong the last few weeks, and it&#8217;s gone&mdash;utterly
gone! Why&mdash;it went when I first looked
at his face. If he had kissed me again, this
time; if&mdash;if he had held me as he did that other
day&mdash;in the woods&mdash;oh, my heart&#8217;s water!
There&#8217;s something in me that <i>won&#8217;t</i> fight. The
ground goes from under my feet. It&#8217;s dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to feel this way! His hair smelled like&mdash;roses!
If I had dared kiss it! I ought to be sorry and
I&#8217;m&mdash;not! I&#8217;m ashamed to be glad, and I&#8217;m glad
to be ashamed!&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt herself shivering, resentful of the ecstasy
of sweetness that lapped and folded her.
The dull glow of the sky irritated her with its
very serenity.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only hadn&#8217;t seen him! If I had been
strong enough not to! It&#8217;s ungenerous of him.
He ought to leave. He ought to have gone away
after that last time! He <i>ought</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>But if he had! The thought obtruded itself.
She had longed for him to come; she knew, down
in her soul, she had. Her heart had given her
lips the lie. The woman in her had betrayed her
conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth!&#8221; she cried, lifting her hand.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the truth! Oh, if he hadn&#8217;t come&mdash;<i>if&mdash;he&mdash;hadn&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;
She muttered it to the wind by the
loneliness of the slashed hedges. &#8220;That would
have been the one last terrible thing. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have crushed me! I could never have been glad
again. I&#8217;m sick now with desolation at the
thought of it! It&#8217;s easier not to be able to forgive
myself than it would be not to be able to forgive
him! But he <i>did</i> come! He wants me!&#8221;
Her voice had a quiver of exultation. &#8220;Nothing
on earth ever can rob me of that!&mdash;nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her arm against her eyes till her
sight blent in golden-lettered flashes. The one
presence was all about her; she could even feel his
breath against her hair. His eyes had been the
color of deep purple grapes under morning dew.
The old hunger for him, for his hand, his voice,
swept down upon her, and she crouched closer to
the ground wet with fog-dew, striking the sod
hard with her hands. He had come. He was
there. He never would go&mdash;she knew that. If
he stayed, she must yield. She had been perilously
close to it that day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a time she became quieter and drew from
her skirt pocket a crumpled letter, received that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
morning after three re-forwardings. It was in a
decisive feminine hand, and spreading it before
her, Margaret turned several pages and began to
read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your letter has somehow distressed me,&#8221; it
read. &#8220;It seemed unlike your old self. It seemed
sad. I imagine that you are troubled about something.
Is it only that you are tired and dissatisfied?
I have wondered much about you since
you left the city in the spring. What have you
been doing? How have you spent the time in the
stale places of idleness? I have been so busy
here at the hospital that I have seen none of our
old friends. Time goes so quickly when you like
your work! And I enjoy mine. It has come to
mean a great deal to me. Dr. Goodno intends
soon, he says, to put me in charge of the children&#8217;s
ward. Poor little things! They suffer so much
more uncomplainingly than grown folks. Dr.
Goodno is our superintendent and Mrs. Goodno
is superintendent of nurses. She has been so dear
and kind to me, one could not help loving her. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hardly seems possible that I have been here three
whole years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret, have you ever thought seriously of
the last letter I wrote you? There is a great deal
of compensation in this life, and I have thought
sometimes (I know you&#8217;ll forgive me for saying
it) that you needed some experience like this.
Every woman ought to be the better for it. You
are my dearest friend, and if I could only show
you something&mdash;some new satisfaction in living&mdash;something
to take you out of yourself more, I
would be so glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told Mrs. Goodno so much about you,
and she would welcome you here, I know. It
might be just what you need. You know the
nurses are taken on three months&#8217; probation, and
there is no compulsion to stay. If you did not
like it, you could leave at any time, and you would
be the gainer by the experience. You need no
preparation. Just telegraph me at any time and
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>A resolution had formed itself rapidly in Margaret&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mind. Thrusting the letter deep into her
pocket, she walked swiftly up the path to the
house. She sent Creed with a telegram before
she entered the library. Melwin was standing
with his back to her, staring out through the
leaded diamonds of the window. He turned
slowly, gazing over her shoulder. His face had
lapsed into its habitual neutral passiveness. His
pupils had contracted into their peculiar unrefracting
dulness, and his hands hung without
motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Melwin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the
city. I have received a letter which makes it
necessary. I think I will take the evening train.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned again to the window. &#8220;Must you&mdash;go?&#8221;
His voice was toneless and dull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I will look in and say
good-by to Lydia.&#8221; She waited a moment uncertainly,
but he did not speak, and she left him
standing there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Turning the knob of Lydia&#8217;s door softly, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pushed it open and entered. Lydia lay with her
face turned toward the wall; her regular breathing
showed that she slept. Margaret could not bear
to awaken her. A wavering smile was on her
parted lips and gave a fragile loveliness to the
delicate transparency of her skin. Perhaps a
happy dream had come for awhile to beckon her
from ever-present pain. Perhaps she was dreaming
that she was well and knew and filled a strong
man&#8217;s yearning.</p>

<p>Margaret closed the door noiselessly. Going
to her room, she pencilled a little note, and tiptoeing
cautiously back through the hall, slipped
the missive under Lydia&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>And this was her farewell.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XII.</h2></div>


<p>Across the country Daunt strode, paying little
heed to his direction. He skirted one field,
crossed another, swung through a gully, scrambled
along a gravel-pit, climbed a hilly slope, and
cut across in a wide circuit. He thought that
physical weariness might bring mental relief.
He paused for a moment by the edge of a clayey
bank, in which a multitude of tiny sand-swallows&mdash;winged
cliff-dwellers&mdash;had pecked them
vaulted homes. He thrust his stick gently into
one of the openings and smiled to see the bridling
anger of its feathered inhabitant.</p>

<p>Seating himself upon a pile of split rails in a
fence corner, he dropped into reverie. He was
conscious of an immense depression. The past
few weeks had brought him nearer to realizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
how much Margaret meant, not only to himself,
but to his labor in the world, than he had ever
been before. His artistic temperament had
pointed him a dreamer, but his natural earnestness
had made him a laborious one. His ideals
were fresh and strong, and the world of tangled
interests and woven ambitions had stood before
him always, mute, importunate, a place to make
them real. In man&#8217;s ear there sound ever three
voices: the brazen-throated throng, the silver-throated
few and the golden-throated one. This
last voice Daunt had learned to listen to. He
had made Margaret his unconscious motive. The
best of his written work had been done at the
huge antique mahogany desk under her picture.
What she had been to his work, what she was
then, showed him what her presence or absence
in his life must inevitably mean. He realized the
truth of what he had once scoffed at, that behind
every man&#8217;s success lies the heart of a woman.</p>

<p>He felt a profound disheartenment. His mind
skimmed the waste of his younger years. It saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
his toils as little things and the work he had
praised in himself as that of a trifler. He knew
now his capacities for ambition. He saw inspiration
for the first time as, on a twilit highway, one
sees a fancied bush, with a sudden movement, resolve
itself into a human figure. He saw his
past, harvestless. Fate had taken his youth, like
a handful of sand, and fed it to the sea! Since
Margaret had gone, his work had been purposeless,
barren&mdash;it wanted her presence.</p>

<p>He had lighted his pipe mechanically, and
through the blue-pale smoke whorls, a near bush
took on the outline of her clear profile, reclined
against a dusky cushion. His longing filled the
silence with an inward voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the woman,&#8221; it said, &#8220;that I have
always wanted! I want you all! I want your
childish shallows and your womanly deeps! I
want your weakness and your strength! I
want you just as you are, no different&mdash;you, yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sitting before him now in the firelight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of her room, where the tongues of the burning
drift-wood and salt-dusted larch sprang up, blue,
magenta and purplish-green, prickling the brass-work
of the fireplace into a thousand many-colored
points, and he was leaning forward, speaking,
with his bare heart behind set lips: &#8220;I love
you. All that I have for you that you will not
own! All that you might be to me that you will
not give!&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt her present trouble vaguely and with
the same impotent resentment that he had felt
in that far-off yet ridiculously near child-life,
when in all the lofty manhood of his eight years
he had defied the cliff-winds&mdash;that childhood
which lived in his memory as a stretch of sun-drowned
sea-beach swept by wind; a dim background
in a frame of sharp outline, which held
little images of delicate fragrance, clear and
sweet, on the retina of his memory. This woman
met him in a pain, measured by his added years,
that he was powerless to appease.</p>

<p>Knocking the cold ashes from his pipe, Daunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rose and stretched his arms wide along the topmost
rail of the shambling fence and gazed out
across the evening hills, blurred by the blue of
distance, into the red sunset. Far to the left,
glooming from encircling elms, lay the house that
sheltered Margaret. Down below him, in the
railroad cut, crawled a deliberate tank-train.
From where he stood, he could see the ungainly
arm of the slung pipe, through which the thirsty
engine drank deep draughts. Sitting in the chill
air had told him his fatigue, and his wrist had
grown stiff and painful. He felt unequal to the
long walk across to Tenbridge, and, consulting
his watch, reflected that the city-bound train, almost
due, would carry him to the little Guthrie
junction, shortening his walk by half.</p>

<p>He pushed rapidly down the hill road, grateful
for the heat of renewed motion. The station was
deserted. One shabby hack drowsed driverless
under the shed, and even the ticket agent had apparently
forsaken his grating.</p>

<p>Sauntering across the platform, Daunt leaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
against the signal-post, on whose swinging arm
a round, fevered eye watched, unwinkingly and
angry, for the distant train, fast growing from a
bright pin point to a blazing blotch of yellow, between
the spun-out rails. Its attenuated rumbling
had swelled to a trembling roar. His pre-occupation
was so deep that the clamorous iron
thing was upon him almost before he heard it.
The surprise jarred him into sudden movement,
and it was then that his tired limbs lurched under
him; the sucking vortex of the hurtling mass
threw him off his balance, he wavered, stumbled,
fell&mdash;and the pitiless armored monster, plunging,
gigantic, regardless, caught him on its mailed
side and passed on, to shudder, to slow, to stop&mdash;too
late!</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XIII.</h2></div>


<p>The gas lamps had been early lit and threw
flaring streaks of white across the dingy platform
as Margaret reached the station. She had
stood on the top of the little slope, looking back
across the fields, grown dim and mysterious in
the purpling dusk, with a tightening of the
throat. However unhappy she had been here,
yet she had seen Daunt. He had stood with her
by those dwarfed hedges, he had pleaded with her
under the flaming boughs of those woods. She
could still feel the strong pressure of his lips upon
her hand as he besought her for what she could
have given him so eagerly, so gladly, so joyously
if she had dared. She was leaving him there, and
the parting now seemed so much more than that
other seaside flight, when she had been stung to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
action by her own self-reproach. Making her
mute farewell, she heard a shriek of steam, as the
train came shuddering into the station, drawing
long, labored breaths like some chained serpent
monster, overtired, and she hastened stumblingly,
uncertainly over the stony road. When she
reached the platform, she was out of breath and
panting, and did not notice the knot of trainmen,
with beckoning arms and dangling lanterns,
by the side of the track.</p>

<p>She sank into her Pullman seat wearily. Several
windows were open and inquiring heads were
thrust forth. She was conscious of a subdued
excitement in the air. A conductor passed hurriedly
through the coach and swung himself
deftly off the end. People about her asked each
other impatiently why the train did not start, and
a sallow-faced woman with a false front hoped
nervously and audibly that nothing was the matter.
A sudden whisper spread itself from chair
to chair, and a man came back from the smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
compartment to seat himself beside his wife, and
pulled down the window-shade with low whisperings.</p>

<p>&#8220;An accident. A man hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret heard it with a tremor. She tried to
raise her window, but the latch caught, and she
placed her face close to the pane to peer out. Up
the platform tramped four trainmen, bloused and
grimy with coal-dust, carrying between them a
board, covered with tarpaulin, under which
showed clearly the outlines of a human figure.</p>

<p>Margaret caught her breath and drew back
with a sudden feeling of faintness. There were
a few tense moments of waiting. Then a quiver
ran through the heavy trucks, there was a sharp
whistle, a snort of escaping steam, and past her
window moved slowly back the station lamps. A
porter went toward the baggage-car, his arms
piled high with white towels, which threw his
ebony face into sharp contrast. The forward
conductor leaned over the occupant of the chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
across from Margaret to borrow his flask, and
went out with it. She realized from this that the
injured one was on the train.</p>

<p>He was probably at that moment lying on the
floor of the baggage-car, amid a litter of trunks
and bags. Men were bending over him to see if
he lived or died. Five minutes ago he had been
as full of life and strength and breath as she.
Now he lay stricken and maimed and ghastly, a
huddle of bleeding flesh and torn sinew, perhaps
never again to see the smile of the sunlight, or,
perhaps, to live mutilated and broken and disfigured,
his every breath a pain, his every pulse a
pang. Perhaps he had loved ones&mdash;a <i>one</i> loved
one, who had hung about his neck and kissed him
when he went away. What of that love when
they should bring this object back to her?</p>

<p>A hideous question of the lastingness of human
love flung itself from the darkness without in
upon her brain. One could love when the face
was fair, when the form was supple and straight,
when the eyes were clear and the blood was young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with the flush of life! One could still love when
age had grayed the hair and the kindly years had
bowed the back. Mutual love need not dim with
time, but only mellow into the peaceful content
of fruition.</p>

<p>But let that straight form be struck down in its
prime: a misstep, a slip in the crowded street, a
broken rail, an explosion in a chemist&#8217;s shop,
and in an instant the beauty is scarred, the symmetrical
limb is twisted, the tender face is seamed
and gnarled. The loved form has gone, and in its
place is left a shape of pain, of repulsion, of
undelight. Ah! what of that love then?</p>

<p>Margaret shivered as if with cold. How could
<i>she</i> answer that? There was a love that did not
live and die in the beating of the heart, which
did not fade into darkness when its outer shell
perished. That was the spirit love. That was
the love of the mother for the child, of the soul
for the kindred soul. That was the love that endured.
It was the only love which justified itself.
It was this that God intended when He put man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and woman in the earth to cherish one another
and gave them living souls which spoke a common
language. Better a million times crush
from the heart any lesser habitant! Better an
empty soul, swept and garnished, than a chamber
of banqueting for a fleshly guest!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Woman&#8217;s heart is the Great Questioner. When
Doubt waves it from natural interrogation of the
world about it, it turns with fearful and inevitable
questionings upon itself, until the sky which had
been thronged with quiring seraphim flocks
thick with sneering devils. &#8220;Do you think,&#8221; insinuates
the Tempter mockingly, &#8220;that this beautiful
dove-eyed love of yours can stand the ultimate
test? Have you tried it? You have seen loves
just as beautiful, just as young, go down into the
pit. Do you dream that yours can endure? Strip
from your love the subtle magnetism of the body,
take from it the hand-touch, the lip-caress, the
pride of the eye, and what have you left? The
hand grows palsied, the lips shrivel, the eye leadens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and love&#8217;s body dies. What then? Ah,
what then!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The darkness had fallen more thickly without,
and Margaret saw her face reflected from the
window-pane, as in a tarnished and trembling
mirror. Her own eyes gazed back at her. She
put up her hands and rubbed them against the
glass, as though to erase the image she saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look so,&#8221; she said, half aloud. &#8220;What
right have you to look so good? Don&#8217;t you know
that if you had staid, if you had seen him again,
you would have thought as he did? You couldn&#8217;t
have helped it! You couldn&#8217;t! You had to run
away! You didn&#8217;t want to come! You wish
you were back again now! You&mdash;you do! You
want him. You want him just as you did&mdash;then!
That&#8217;s the worst of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face in the glass made her no answer. It
angered her that those eyes would offer no glance
of self-defence, and, with a quick impulse, she
reached up and drew down the shade.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>The whir and click of the flying wheels jarred
through her brain. She had a sense of estrangement
from herself. She felt almost as though
she were two persons. The one Margaret riding
in her pillowed chair, with her mind a turmoil of
evil doubts, and the other Margaret rushing on
by her side through the outer night, calm-eyed
and untroubled, and these two almost touching
and yet separated by an infinite distance. They
could never clasp each other again. She had a
vague feeling that there was a deeper purpose of
punishment in this. She herself had raised the
ghost which must haunt her.</p>

<p>She hardly noted the various stations as the
train stopped and breathed a moment, and then
dashed on. Try as she would, her thoughts recurred
to the baggage-car and the burden it carried.
She wondered whether they would put it
off quickly at the terminal, and what it would look
like. It was for such things that hospitals were
built, and to a hospital with all that it implied, she
was bound. New and torturing doubts of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
own strength beset her. She was afraid. In her
imagination she already smelled the sickening
sweet halitus of iodoform and saw white-aproned
nurses winding endless bandages upon bleeding
gashes that would not be stanched.</p>

<p>An engulfing rumbling told her that they were
entering the city tunnel, and near-by passengers
began a deliberate assortment of wraps and parcels.
The porter passed through the train, loudly
announcing the last stop. There was almost a
relief to Margaret&#8217;s overwrought sensibilities in
his sophisticated utterance. It was a part of the
great cube-jumbled, fish-ribbed metropolis, with
its clanging noises and its swirl of cañoned living
for which during the past weeks she had thirsted
feverishly. She felt, without putting it into actual
mental expression, that surcharged thought
might find relief in simple things.</p>

<p>Lois would be waiting there to meet her. She
would be glad to see her. It was pleasant to be
loved and looked for. A moment or two more
and the white, smoky haze that blotted the car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
windows lifted, and in place of the milky opaque
squares appeared glimpses of wide-lit spaces and
springing ironwork. The car hesitated, shocked
itself with a succession of gentle jars, and came
heavily to a halt. They were in the station.</p>

<p>Margaret alighted on the platform with limbs
numb and tired. The strain of the day had given
her a yearning for quiet, for the abandon of a
deep chair with soft cushions, and a cup of tea.
She met Lois with outstretched arms and a wan
and uncertain smile against which her lips feebly
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Margaret, dear, how tired you look!&#8221;
said Lois, kissing her. &#8220;Come, and we&#8217;ll get a
cab just outside. Your train was very late. I
thought you never <i>would</i> get here at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret clung to Lois&#8217;s hands. &#8220;O&mdash;h,&#8221; she
said, falteringly, &#8220;do we have to go up the whole
length of the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; are you so very tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, ashamed of her
weakness. She was coming to be a nurse&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
learn to care for sick people and to dress wounds.
What would Lois think of her? &#8220;Do&mdash;do they
unload the baggage-car now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Lois, cheerfully, &#8220;we&#8217;ll leave your
checks here; it won&#8217;t be necessary to wait for the
trunks. Come, dear!&#8221; She led the way up
the thronged platform. &#8220;Hurry!&#8221; she said suddenly,
&#8220;there is a case in the baggage-car. I
wonder where it&#8217;s going! Oh, you poor darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret had turned very pale and leaned
against a waiting truck for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot. That <i>is</i> a rather stiff beginning for
you, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m <i>so</i> sorry! I hope you didn&#8217;t
see; it looks like a bad one. Don&#8217;t watch it, dear.
That&#8217;s right! You won&#8217;t mind it a bit after a
while. You&#8217;re quite worn out now. Come, we&#8217;ll
go around this other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It happened at Warne,&#8221; said Margaret, tremulously.
&#8220;I saw them take him on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor dear! and you must have been worrying
about it all the way in. Do you see the ambulance
at the curb? That&#8217;s ours. You see, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
telegraphed, and now he will be cared for sooner
than you get your tea. There goes the ambulance
gong! They&#8217;re off. And now here&#8217;s the
cab.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XIV.</h2></div>


<p>An hour later, Margaret, somewhat composed
from her ride, waited in the homelike bedroom
for Lois to come and take her to Mrs. Goodno,
the Superintendent of Nurses. From her post
at the window she could look down upon the
street.</p>

<p>It had begun to rain, and the electric lights
hurled misshapen Swedish-yellow splotches on
the wet asphalt. The wind had risen, rending the
clouds into shaggy lines and made a dreary, disconsolate
singing in the web of telephone wires
bracketed beneath the window. Margaret felt herself
to be in a state of unnatural tension. She gazed
out into the swathing darkness, trying desperately
to make out the landscape. Her eyes wandered
from the clumps of wet and glistening foliage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the starting lights in a far-off apartment house,
which thrust its massive top, fortress-like, and,
with proportions exaggerated by the lowering
scud, up into the air. Do what she would, her
mind recurred, as though from some baleful
necessity, to the details of the long train-ride.
The never-ending clack of the wheels was in her
ears. She clenched her hands as the landscape
resolved itself into the dim station at Warne, and
she saw again the grimy brakemen carrying
something by covered with a dirty canvas.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes to drag them away from the
window. How could she ever stand it! It had
been a mistake&mdash;a horrible, ghastly mistake! She
had turned cold and sick when they had carried
it past the car window. How could she ever bear
to see things like that? Lois did. Lois liked it!
So did all of them. But they were different.
There must be something hideously wrong about
her&mdash;it was part of her unwomanliness&mdash;part of
her guilty lack. The others saw the quivering
soul beneath the sick flesh; she could never see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
within the bodily tenement. She was handcuffed
to her lower side. She remembered the story of
the criminal, chained by wrist and ankle to a comrade;
how he woke one day to find the other
dead&mdash;<i>dead</i>&mdash;and himself condemned to drag
about with him, day and night, that horrible, inert
thing. She, Margaret Langdon, was like this
man. She must drag through life this corpse of
a dead spirituality, this finer comrade soul of
hers which had somehow died! Her life must
be one long hypocrisy&mdash;one unending deceit. She
was even there under false pretences. They
would not want her if they knew.</p>

<p>She turned toward the fireplace. Over it hung
a sepia print of the Madonna of the Garden. The
glow touched the rounded chin and chubby knees
of the little St. John with a soft flesh-tint, and
left in shadow the quaint incongruity of the
distant church-spire. Margaret&#8217;s whole spirit
yearned toward its placid purity. She had had
the same print hung in her bedroom at home, and
it had looked down upon her when she prayed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
She gazed at it now with eyes of wretchedness,
filmed with tears. Her throat ached acutely with
a repressed desire to sob. She fancied that the
downcast lids lifted and that the luminous, wide
eyes followed her wonderingly, reproachfully.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lois came in smiling. &#8220;She is in now,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and we will go down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret exerted herself and tried to chat
bravely as they went along the corridor, and entered
the cool silence of the room where Lois&#8217;s
friend waited to meet her. There was a restfulness
in Mrs. Goodno&#8217;s neat attire, and a dignity
about her clear profile, full, womanly throat and
strong, capable wrists, that seemed to be an inseparable
part of her atmosphere. Her firm and
unringed hands held Margaret&#8217;s with a suggestion
of tried strength and assured poise that bore
comfort. Her eyes were deep gray, smiling less
with humor, one felt, than with a constant inward
reflection of welcome thoughts. Her hair
was a dull, toneless black, carried back under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
lace cap in a single straight sweep that left the
hollows of her neck in deep shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are Miss Langdon?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Lois
has told me so much about you. Do sit down.
Tea will be here directly, and I want to give you
some, for I know you have had a long, dreary
ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>She busied herself renewing the grate fire,
while Margaret watched her with straying eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she said, returning, &#8220;we people
who spend our lives taking care of broken human
bodies have to be strong ourselves. You are
strong; I see that, though your face has tired
lines in it now. But we must be more than that&mdash;our
minds must be healthy. We can&#8217;t afford to
be morbid. We have to have cheerful hearts.
We must see the beauty of the great pattern that
depends on these soiled and tangled threads we
keep straightening out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;do you think we have to
be happy to do any good in the world? How can
we be happy unless we work? And if we start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
miserable&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, with an acute sense
of wretchedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not happy necessarily. There are things
in some of our lives which make that impossible;
but we can be cheerful. Cheerfulness depends
not on our past acts, but on our wholesome view
of life, and we get this by learning to understand
it and to understand ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, do you think,&#8221; questioned Margaret,
&#8220;do you think we always do in the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I believe we do. It&#8217;s unfailing. I
proved it to myself, for I began life by being a
very unnatural girl, and a very unhappy one. I
misunderstood my own emotions, as all young
girls do. I didn&#8217;t know how to treat myself. I
didn&#8217;t even know I was sick. I had been brought
up in New England, and I tortured myself with
religion. It wasn&#8217;t the wickedness of the world
that troubled me; I expected too much of myself&mdash;we
all do at a certain age. And, because I
found weakness where I hadn&#8217;t suspected it, I
thought I was all wrong. You know we New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Englanders have a peculiar aptitude for self-torture,
and I wore my hair-cloth shirt and pressed it
down on the sores. It was the University Settlement
idea that first drew me out of myself. I
went into that and worked at first only for my
own sake; but, after a while, for the work&#8217;s sake.
It was only work I wanted, my dear, and contact
with real things. Out of the turmoil and mixture
and pain I got my first real satisfaction. In its
misery and want and degradation I learned that
an isolated grief is always selfish. I learned the
part that our human bodies play in life. I began
to see a meaning in the plan and to understand
the part in it of what I had thought the lower
things in us. Then I got into the hospital work,
and you will soon see what that is. It has shown
me humanity. It has taught me the nobility of
the human side of us. It makes me broader to
understand and quicker to feel; and it isn&#8217;t depressing.
There is a great deal in it that is
sunny. I hope you will like it. But we are not
all made in the same mould, and we regard your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
coming, of course, merely as an experiment. So,
if you feel at any time that it is not for you, come
to me and tell me. Come to me any time and talk
with me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you have finished your tea, and I must
go to the children&#8217;s ward. I have put you with
Lois till the strangeness of it wears off, and you
can have a separate room whenever you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaning forward, she brushed Margaret&#8217;s
cheek lightly with her lips and went quickly out
of the room.</p>

<p>In spite of her misery, a shy feeling of comfort
had come into Margaret&#8217;s heart. She rose and
surveyed herself in the mirror over the mantel,
drawing a deep breath and raising her shoulders
as she did so. It was an unconscious trick of
hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she said half aloud, &#8220;that is the
temptation. I want to think it, and it can&#8217;t be
true. I <i>want</i> to! The want in me is bad! How
<i>can</i> it be true?&#8221; &#8220;The nobility of the human side
of us&#8221;&mdash;ah, that had come from the calm poise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a wholesome understanding! It was noble&mdash;this
human side&mdash;but not king. What of this
strange mastery that overflowed her, the actual
ache for the glow of his eyes, the pressure of his
fingers? The mere memory of it was like a live
coal to her cheeks. It burned her. The feel of
his strong hair was in the fibrous touch of her
gown. His mouth, smiling at the corners, warmed
her shoulder. His bodily presence was all about
her; it breathed upon her, and her soul reeled and
shut its eyes like a drunken man!</p>

<p>Margaret tossed her hands above her head, the
wrists dropping crosswise upon the shearing pillow
of her flame-washed hair. In the mirror she
saw the pale oval of her face in this living setting.
As she gazed, the features warmed and changed;
the eyes became Daunt&#8217;s eyes&mdash;the mouth,
Daunt&#8217;s mouth. It was Daunt&#8217;s face, as she had
looked up into it framed in her arms on the sun-brilliant
beach. The wind was all about her,
fresh and odorous, and his kisses were falling
upon her seasalt lips!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Still holding her arms raised, she leaned to the
mirror and kissed the glass hungrily. Her breath
sighed the picture dim. The magic of it was
gone, and Margaret, glancing fearfully behind
her, turned and ran breathless to her room, where
she locked the door and threw herself upon the
bed, pressing her face down into the soft pillow
gaspingly, to shut out the vivid passion-laden
odor of bruised roses that seemed to pursue her,
filling all her senses like a far-faint smell of musk.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XV.</h2></div>


<p>Margaret passed along through the light-freshened
ward, following Lois closely, and fighting
desperately the active feeling of nausea which almost
overcame her. All her sensitive nature
cringed in this atmosphere. Through the brightness
and cleanliness of wood and metal, the absolute
whiteness of the stamped bed-linen and the
fresh smell of antiseptics, she had a morbid sense
of the ugliness of disease, of the loathsomeness of
contact with physical decrepitude that is one of
the selfishnesses of the artistic temperament. She
felt the dread, incubus-like, pressing upon her and
sucking from her what force and vitality she had.
A feeling of despair of being able to cope with
this thrusting melancholy beset her and she
fought it off with her strongest strength.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>At intervals, as they passed, was a cot shut off
by screens of white linen, fluted and ironed, as
high as the eyes. These spotless blanks stood
out more awful to Margaret in intimation of hidden
horror than any open physical convulsion.
Behind these screens was more often silence, but
sometimes came forth an indistinct and restless
muttering, and once a sharp, panging groan. A
sick apprehension gripped her, and she felt her
palms growing moist with sweat. She was sickly
sensible of the sweet, pungent smell of carbolic
and ether, sharpened by a spicy odor of balsam-of-Peru.
From the pillows curious eyes peered
at her, set in faces sharp-featured and hectic, or
a shambling figure in loose garments moved, bent
and halting, across their path. She caught a
sidewise view, through a swing door, of a tiled
operating-room, with a glittering <i>mêlée</i> of polished
instruments. Here and there she thought
the lapping folds of bandages moved, showing
blue glimpses of gaping cuts and festering tissue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
It seemed as if the long rows of white coverlids
and iron bed-bars would go on eternally.</p>

<p>As they came to the extreme end of the room,
Margaret suddenly stopped, gripping Lois&#8217;s arm
with vise-close fingers. &#8220;What is that?&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is what?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood listening, her neck bent sideways,
and a flush of excitement rising on her cheeks.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear him call me?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear him? Hear who?&#8221; said Lois.</p>

<p>But she did not answer. &#8220;Take me away; oh,
take me away!&#8221; she said weakly. &#8220;I want to go
back to the room. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you what I
thought I heard. It would sound such nonsense.
I must have imagined it. Oh, of course I imagined
it! Oh, Lois, I don&#8217;t believe I will ever be
any good here, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lois drew her into the outside corridor and up
the hall. &#8220;I do believe you are sick yourself!&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Why, you have quite a fever. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
is something troubling you, dear, I&#8217;m sure. Can&#8217;t
you tell me about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Indeed there is nothing!&#8221; cried
Margaret. &#8220;Lois, I want to see <i>all</i> the patients&mdash;the
worst ones. Promise me you&#8217;ll take me with
you when you go around to-night. Indeed, indeed,
I must! You <i>must</i> let me! I will be
just as quiet! You will see! You think it
wouldn&#8217;t be best&mdash;that I&#8217;m too fanciful and sensitive
yet&mdash;but indeed, it isn&#8217;t that. Maybe it&#8217;s
because I only look on from a distance. I don&#8217;t
touch it, actually. I&#8217;m only a spectator. If I
could go quite close, or do something to help
with my hands, maybe they would seem more like
people, and the sickness of it would leave me.
Do, dear, say I may to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached the room now, and Lois
gently forced Margaret upon the lounge. &#8220;Very
well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will. I&#8217;m going through at
nine o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;m not afraid of your sensitiveness.
It&#8217;s the sensitive ones who make the best nurses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Dr. Goodno says. They can <i>feel</i> their diagnosis.
But you must lie down till I can come for you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Left alone, Margaret pressed her head into the
cushions and tried to think. She could not shake
off the real impression of that cry. &#8220;Ardee!
Ardee!&#8221; It had come to her with such suddenness
that every nerve had jumped and jerked.
Could she have dreamed it? Was the sound of
that old intimate name of hers, breathed in that
peculiar voice, only a trick of the imagination?
Surely it must have been! Her nerves were
overwrought and frayed. She was hysterical.
It was only the muttering of some fever patient!
And yet, she had felt that she must see. An indefinable
impulse had urged her to beg Lois to
take her with her. And now the same horror
would seize her again, the same sickening repulsion,
and she would have the same fight over.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Lois came for her, Margaret prepared
herself quickly and they passed down. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
door of the surgical ward they met the house surgeon,
who nodded to Margaret at Lois&#8217;s introduction.
&#8220;Just going in to see Faulkner&#8217;s trephine
case,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a funny sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he coming through all right?&#8221; asked Lois.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the one that was brought in on your train
the other night, Margaret,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to be the very devil. He
took a nasty temperature this afternoon, and the
nurse got worried and called me up. I found we
had a good old-fashioned case of sepsis&mdash;wound
full of pus and all that. What makes it bad is
that he has hemiplegia. The whole left side
seems to be paralyzed. The operation didn&#8217;t relieve
the brain pressure, and with his temperature
where it is now, we&#8217;ll have to simply take care of
that and let any further examination go. I&#8217;ve
just telephoned to Faulkner. It won&#8217;t be a satisfactory
case, anyway. There is possibly some
deeper brain injury in the motor area, and if we
beat the poison out, he stands to turn out a helpless
cripple. Some people are never satisfied,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
he continued, irritably. &#8220;When they start out to
break themselves up, they have to do it in some
confounded combination that&#8217;s the very devil to
patch up. Coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>He held the door open, and they followed him
quickly to a nest of screens at the upper end of
the ward, passing in with him.</p>

<p>Margaret forced her unwilling eyes to regard
the patient as the doctor laid a finger upon his
pulse, attentively examined the temperature chart,
and departed. He lay with his left side toward
them. The head was partly shaven, hideous with
bandages, and in an ice-pack. The side-face was
drawn, distorted and expressionless. His left
hand lay quiet, but the fingers of the right picked
and tumbled and drummed on the coverlid unceasingly.
He was muttering to himself in peculiar,
excitable monotone. On a sudden his voice
rose to audible pitch:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then! you&#8217;ll come. Don&#8217;t say you won&#8217;t!
Why&mdash;you can&#8217;t help it! You <i>will</i>! Do you
hear? * * * * Take the straight pike to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
crossroads, and then two miles further on. The
Drennen place&mdash;yes, I know!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the tone Margaret started in uncontrollable
excitement. An inarticulate cry broke from her.
She ran to the foot of the bed, and, her fingers
straining on the bars, gazed with fearful questioning
into the features of the sick man. As she
gazed, his head rolled feebly on the pillow, displaying
the right side of the face. Then a low,
terrible, choking, sobbing cry rose to her lips&mdash;a
cry of pain, of remonstrance, of desolation.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s my&mdash;my&mdash;it&#8217;s Richard Daunt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lois reached her in a single step and held her,
trembling. But after that one bitter sob she was
absolutely silent. She hardly breathed; all her
soul seemed to be looking out of her deep eyes.
The uncouth mumbling went on, uncertain but
incessant.</p>

<p>&#8220;* * Drennen place. That&#8217;s where she is. I&#8217;ll
find her! Let me go! Quick, take this off my
head! I tell you, I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to go! * * * Oh, my
dear, don&#8217;t you want to see me? You look like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
an autumn leaf in that scarlet cloak. Come closer
to me. Your hair is like flame and you&#8217;re pale&mdash;pale&mdash;pale!
Look at me! * * * How dare you
treat me this way? How dare you! You knew
I&#8217;d come to you&mdash;you knew I couldn&#8217;t help it.
Some one told me you didn&#8217;t want me to come.
* * * It was a letter, wasn&#8217;t it? Some one
wrote me a letter. But it was a lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lois readjusted the ice-pack, and the voice died
down into broken mutterings. Then he began
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Richard Daunt? You&#8217;ve got to make
her understand! You&#8217;ve got to, and you can&#8217;t.
You&#8217;ve failed. She used to love you, and now
she&#8217;s gone away and left you. She won&#8217;t come
back! You can go to the devil! * * * Ardee!
See how your hair shines against the old cross!
Pray for her soul! Pray&mdash;for&mdash;her&mdash;soul! * *
Ardee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret bowed her face on her hands, still
clasping the bed-rail. Great, clear tears welled
up in her eyes and splashed upon the coverlid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
She saw, as if through a fleering maze of windy
rain-sheets, the dull, round, staring eyes, the yellow
skin, the restless fingers and unlovely lips.
Then she stood upright, swaying back and putting
both hands to her temples as though something
tense had snapped in her brain.</p>

<p>A pained wonder was in the look she turned on
Lois&mdash;something the look of a furred wood-animal
caught by the thudding twinge of a bullet.
The next moment she threw herself softly on her
knees by the cot, stretching her arms across the
straightened figure, pressing her lips to the
rounded outline of the knees, and between these
kisses, lifting her face, swollen with sobless crying,
to gaze at the rolling, unrecognizing features
beside her. Agony was in the puffed hollows
beneath her eyes, and her lips were drawn
with the terrible yearning of a mother for her
ailing child.</p>

<p>Lois raised her forcefully, yet feeling a strange
powerlessness, and drew her away, with a finger
on her lip and a warning glance beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
screens, and Margaret followed her with the
tranced gaze of a sleep-walker. There was no
repugnance or distrust in it now, or fleshly horror
of sickness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In her room again, she stood before the window,
her mind reaching out for the new sweetness
that had dropped around her. All that she
had thought strongest in her old love had shrunk
to pitiful detail. Between her young, lithe body
and the broken and ravaged wreck she had seen,
there could then be no bond of bounding blood
and throbbing flesh; but love, masterful, undismayed,
had cried for its own. Something was
dissolving within her heart&mdash;something breaking
down and away of its own weight. She felt
the fight finished. It had not been fought out,
but the combatants who had gripped throat in
the darkness had started back in the new dawn,
to behold themselves brothers. There was a primal
directness in the blow that had thrust her
back&mdash;somewhere&mdash;back from all self-questionings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and the torture of mental misunderstanding,
upon herself. It was an appeal to Cæsar. Beneath
the decree, the rigidity of belief that had
lain back of her determination turned suddenly
flexible. She did not try to reason&mdash;she felt.
But this feeling was ultimate, final. She knew
that she could never doubt herself again.</p>

<p>The green glints from the grass-plots on the
tree-lined street and the sun on the gray asphalt
filled her with a warm tenderness. Every bird
in all the world was piping full-throated; every
spray on every bush was hung with lush blossoms
and drenched with fragrance. The swell of filling
lungs and tumultuous blood&mdash;the ecstasy of
breathing had returned to her. The joy-bitter
gladness of the heart and the world, the enfolding
arms of the unforgot, clasped her round. It
was for her the Soul&#8217;s renaissance. The Great
Illumination had come!</p>

<p>As Lois gazed at her, mystified, she turned,
with both hands pressed against her breast, and
laughed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVI.</h2></div>


<p>Closing the door, Margaret opened her trunk
and from the very bottom produced a slender
bunch of letters. She lit the small metal lamp
and placed it on the wicker chair, kneeling beside
it with an unreasoning sense that there was a
fitness in the posture. Her fingers trembled as
she touched the black ribbon which held the letters,
and she stayed herself, swaying against a
chair, as she unknotted it. There were a few
folded sheets of paper&mdash;pencilled notes left for
her&mdash;a telegram or two, and four letters. Before
she read the first letter, she laid it against her
face, lovingly, as though it were a sentient thing.
She read them one by one very slowly, sometimes
smiling faintly with a childish trembling of
the lips&mdash;smiles that were followed quickly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
tears which gathered in her great eyes and rolled
down her cheeks. When she had finished reading
the last one, she made a little pile of them. Then,
taking from her trunk writing paper, ink and pen,
she laid them upon the floor beside the pile of letters
and stretched herself full length upon the
heavy rug. As she lay leaning upon her elbows,
with eyes gazing straight before her, she looked
like some desolate, wind-broken reed over which
the storm had passed. She wrote slowly, with
careful fingers, forming her letters with almost
laborious precision, like a little child who writes
for a special and fond eye:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;My Beloved: Please forgive me. Please try
to forget how cruel I was and think kindly of me.
I have been so wretched. All through the slow
days since I went away, I have longed so for you.
All the many dark nights I have dreamed of you
and cried for you. If you could only know now
while you are suffering so. If you could only
know how I longed for you all that time, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not suffer so now. I want so much to tell you.
I want to tell you that I love you every way and
all ways. I loved you this way all the time, only
I didn&#8217;t know it, and I wanted to love you the
way I know I do now. I must have been mad, I
think. I was so selfish and so cruel, and I thought
I was trying to be so good. I could die when I
think that it was I who brought all this suffering
upon you. To think that you might have
been killed and that I might never have been able
to tell you! Richard, I have learned what love
is. Do other women ever have to learn it as
hardly, I wonder?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, it was not until to-day that I
knew you were here&mdash;that you were hurt? And
yet we came here on the same train together. If
God had let me know it then, I think I should
have died on that long, terrible journey. You
did not know what you were saying, and I heard
you call &#8216;Ardee! Ardee!&#8217; just as you used to at
the beach. That cry reached out of the dark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
took hold of my heart as though it were an invisible
hand drawing me to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I had been running away from you when
I came&mdash;running away from you and myself. I
knew you meant to stay at Warne and see me
again. And I knew if I saw you again, I could
not struggle any longer&mdash;you were so strong.
And you were right, too; I know that now, dear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time I met you in the field, my heart
leaped to tell you &#8216;yes.&#8217; I was so hungry&mdash;hungry&mdash;hungry
for you. And I was afraid of my
own self. I distrusted my own heart, but it was
only because I wanted to love you with my soul&mdash;with
the other side of me&mdash;the side that I did not
know, that I could not feel sure you filled. Oh,
you must have thought me unnatural, abnormal,
hateful. Dear, such doubts come to women, and
they are terrible things. There is more of the
elemental in men. The finer&mdash;the further passion
of love they know, when women fail to
grasp it. We have to learn it&mdash;it is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
lessons which men teach us. When my heart
was so full of doubt, I made up my mind to crucify
my bodily sensibilities. It seemed to me
that I must let my soul come uppermost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember how I never could bear
to look at your collie that was sick, and how terribly
ill I got when I tried to tie up your hand
the day you cut it? All through my life, I have
never been able to look on suffering or pain. I
always used to avoid it or shirk it. When I got
to thinking, at Warne, of my own soul, it seemed
to me that I had been unwomanly and selfish,
cruelly, heartlessly selfish, and that I had dwarfed
that soul that I must make grow again.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I came down here.</p>

<p>&#8220;All along I have had such a horror of this
place. I could not overcome it. Every hour was
full of misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day I went through the wards and I found
you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, I am so happy and I am so miserable&mdash;miserable
because I have found you suffering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Every moment is a long agony to me. And
happy because I have found myself. My soul
and I are friends again. Some wonderful miracle
was worked for me to-day, and it is so brilliant,
so wonderful, that it has left no room in my
mind for anything else.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not the old familiar face that I saw
against the pillows to-night. It was not the old
dear voice that called to me. It was not the old
Daunt. The wavy hair is gone, and there is no
color in your cheeks. But, dear, when I saw
your poor face all drawn and your lips all cracked
with fever, my heart came up in my throat so that
I could not breathe. I wanted to kiss your face,
your hands. I wanted to kiss even the bandages
that were around your head. I wanted to put
my arms around you. I felt strong enough to
keep anything from you&mdash;even death. All in a
moment it seemed to me that I was your mother,
and you were my little child who was sick. And
yet so much more so&mdash;infinitely much more than
that. It came to me then like a flash, how wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&mdash;wickedly
wrong I had been. Everything disappeared
but you and me. It was not your body
that I loved. It was not the body that that
broken thing had been that I loved, but it was
you&mdash;<i>you</i>, the inner something for whose sake I
had loved the Richard Daunt that I knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could not speak to me. You did not know
that I was there. You could not plead with me,
but my own self pleaded. You&#8217;ll never have to
beg me to stay or go with you again. You need
me now&mdash;only I know how much. You cannot
even know that I am near you, that I am talking
to you, that I am telling you all about it. I know
that you will never see this letter, and yet somehow
it eases my heart a little to write it. I have
read over all the letters that you have sent me,
and they are such brave, such true letters. I
understand them now. They have been read and
cried over a great many times since you wrote
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am waiting now every day, every hour when
I can tell you all this with my own lips, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
when your dear eyes will open again and smile up
into mine with the old boyish smile&mdash;and when
you will put your arms around my neck and tell
me that you know all about it, and that you forgive
me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Her tears had been dropping fast upon the
page, and she stopped from time to time to wipe
them with the draping meshes of her loose, rust-colored
hair. She did not even turn as she heard
a hand at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Margaret!&#8221; said Lois, &#8220;it is two o&#8217;clock
in the morning, and I have just finished my last
round. Come, child, you must go to bed at once.
I see that I have got to be a stern chaperon.
What! writing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a letter,&#8221; said Margaret. &#8220;I have just
finished it.&#8221; She lifted the tongs and poked the
fire-logs until there was a crackling blaze, then
she gathered up the loose ink-stained sheets carefully,
and, leaning forward, laid them in a square
white heap upon the red embers. The flame
sprang up and around them, reaching for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
voraciously. And Lois, seeing the action, but
making no comment, came and sat down on the
rug beside Margaret, and wistfully and tenderly
drew the brown, bowed head into her sisterly
arms.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XVII.</h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Lois&#8221;&mdash;Mrs. Goodno, standing in the doorway,
drew her favorite close beside her&mdash;&#8220;look
at the picture coming down the hall! Isn&#8217;t she
beautiful?&#8221; There was a spontaneous and genuine
admiration in her tone as she spoke.</p>

<p>A something indefinable, an atmosphere of
loveliness, seemed to breathe from Margaret&#8217;s
every motion as she came toward them. Her
cheeks had a delicate flush, her glance was
bright and roving, and her perfect lips were
tremulous. Her look had a new mystery in it&mdash;a
brooding tenderness, like the look of a young
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;All through the nurses&#8217; lecture this morning,&#8221;
said Lois, &#8220;I noticed her. When she smiled it
made one want to smile, too!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>As Margaret reached them and greeted Mrs.
Goodno, Lois joined her, and the two girls walked
down the hall together to their room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Lois, as she took a text-book
from the drab-backed row on the low corner
shelf, and assumed a judicial demeanor, &#8220;I&#8217;m
morally certain that you haven&#8217;t studied your
Weeks-Shaw this morning, and I&#8217;m going to quiz
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret broke into a laugh. &#8220;Try it,&#8221; she
said gayly. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to ask me to define
health, and to show the difference between objective
and subjective symptoms, and tell you what
is a mulberry-tongue. Health is a perfect circulation
of pure blood in a sound organism. How
is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Lois, sitting down by the window,
was laughing, too. &#8220;When the doctor quizzes
you, you may not know it so well! Suppose you
explain to me the theory of counter-irritants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret swooped down upon her, and kneeling
by her chair, put both hands over the page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
looking up into her face. &#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;What do I care for it all to-day! Oh, Lois!
Lois!&#8221; she whispered in the hushed voice of a
child about to tell a dear secret, &#8220;I am so happy!
I am so happy that I can&#8217;t tell it! To think that
I can watch him and nurse him, and take his temperature!
I can help cure him and see him get
better and better every day. When he talks, he
pronounces queerly and his words get all jumbled
up, and his sentences have no ends to them, but
I love to hear it&mdash;I know what they are trying to
say! He is so weak that I feel as if I were his
mother. I know you&#8217;ve told Mrs. Goodno;
haven&#8217;t you, dear? Somehow I knew it just now
when she smiled at us! I don&#8217;t care if you did&mdash;not
a bit&mdash;if she will only let me stay by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lois patted the bronzing gloss of the uplifted
head. &#8220;I did tell her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I thought I
ought to&mdash;but she understands. Never fear
about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what makes me so happy! I love
all the world, Lois! Did you ever feel that way?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>The light wing of a shadow brushed the face
above her, and deep in its eyes darkled a something
hidden there that was almost envy.</p>

<p>The voice went running on: &#8220;Suppose he
should open his eyes suddenly to-night&mdash;conscious!
Do you know what I would do? I
would slip off this apron all in a minute, so he
should see me and know me first of all. I have
my hair the way he likes it. I wish I could do
more for him! Love is service. I want to tire
myself out doing things to help him. Why, only
think! It was my fault he was hurt. I sent him
away when it was breaking my heart to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he should know you to-day, dear,&#8221; Lois
said, her face flashing into a smile, &#8220;it ought to
help him get well. There is joy bubbling out all
over you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad he&#8217;s not conscious now, for when
he isn&#8217;t he doesn&#8217;t suffer. Sometimes last night
he seemed to, and then I ached all over to suffer
for him. I could laugh out loud through the
pain, to think that I was bearing it for him! Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Lois, I haven&#8217;t understood. I see now what
you love in this life here. It isn&#8217;t only bodies
that you are curing; it&#8217;s souls&mdash;that you&#8217;re making
sound houses for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing Lois&#8217;s arm through hers, Margaret
pointed to where the huge entrance showed, from
the deep window. &#8220;Do you know, the first day
we came in there together, I was the unhappiest
girl in the world. It seemed as though I was
being dragged into some dreadful black cave,
where there was no sun, no flowers, nothing but
ghastly sights and people that were dying! The
first day I went with you through the wards I
hated it. I wanted to shut my eyes and run away
as far as I could from it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that; I saw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that is all changed. I never shall
see a body suffer again without wanting to put
my hands on it and soothe it. Life is so much
sweeter and deeper than I knew! It&#8217;s hard to be
quiet. I&#8217;m walking to music. I must go around
all the time singing. It seems wicked of me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
be so happy when I know that it will be days and
days yet before he can even sit up and let me read
to him. But I can&#8217;t help it. I was so wretched
all the time before, that the joy now seems to be a
part of me. It seems to be his joy, too. He
would be glad if he could know that, in spite of
all I thought and everything I said, I love him
now as he wanted me to, and that nothing ever
can come between us again! Isn&#8217;t it time to go
in yet? I can hardly wait for the hour!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lois looked at her watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s near enough,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Come. Dr. Faulkner is somewhere in
the ward now, and I must get instructions.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Daunt lay perfectly quiet, his restless hand still.
An orderly was changing the phials upon the
glass-topped table and nodded to them.</p>

<p>Lois darted a quick glance at the face on the
pillow, and her own changed. A stealthy fear
crept over her. Margaret&#8217;s head was turned
away toward the cot. How should she tell her?
How let her know that subtle change of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
few hours that her own trained eye noted? How
let out for her the strenuous agony that waited
in that room? The pitiful unconsciousness of
evil in the graceful posture went through her
with a start of anguish.</p>

<p>The soft footfall of the visiting surgeon drew
near, and with swift prescience she moved close
to Margaret. He bent over the figure in rapid
professional inquiry and consulted the chart, nodding
his head as he tabulated his observations in
a running, semi-audible comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&mdash;m! well-developed septic fever. Delirium
comes on at night, you say, nurse. Eh? H&mdash;m!
Pulse very rapid and stringy&mdash;hurried and shallow
breathing&mdash;eyes dull, with inequality of
pupils. H&mdash;m! Face flushed&mdash;lips blue&mdash;extremities
cold. Lips and teeth covered with sordes&mdash;typical
case. H&mdash;m! Complete lethargy&mdash;clammy
sweat&mdash;face assuming a hippocratic type.
Temperature sub-normal. H&mdash;m! Yes. Nurse,
please preserve all notes of this case. It&#8217;s interesting.
Very. Like to see it in the &#8216;Record.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8220;What are the probabilities, doctor?&#8221; It was
the sentence. Lois&#8217;s lips were trembling, and she
put a hand on Margaret&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probabilities? H&mdash;m! Give him about twelve
hours and that&#8217;s generous. Never any hope in a
case of this kind. Why, the man&#8217;s dying now.
Look at his face.&#8221;</p>

<p>A piteous, chalky whiteness swept like a wave
over Margaret&#8217;s cheeks, but she had made no
sound. When the doctor was quite gone, she
swerved a little on her feet, as though her limbs
had weakened, and her lips opened and shut
voicelessly, as if whispering to herself. Lois
dreaded a cry, but there was none; she only shut
her eyes, and covered her poor face, gone suddenly
pinched and pallid, with her two hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Margaret.&#8221; Lois held out a hand
whose professional coolness was touched with an
unwonted tremor. &#8220;Wait a moment, dear.&#8221; She
ran to the hall to see that no one was in sight.
Then running back and putting her arm around
Margaret&#8217;s shoulders, she led her, blind and unresisting,
to the stair.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII.</h2></div>


<p>The house surgeon stretched his long legs
lazily in a corner of the office and looked at the
hospital superintendent through the purplish
haze from his cigar. &#8220;I wonder, Goodno,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;that you have time to get interested in any
one case among so many. I&#8217;d like to see the one
you speak of pull through; it&#8217;s a rather unusual
case, and a trephine always absorbs me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Goodno lighted a companion cigar. &#8220;My
interest in him isn&#8217;t wholly professional,&#8221; he
answered slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s personal. In the first
place, he isn&#8217;t an Italian stevedore or a Pole peddler
from Baxter street. He is a man of a great
deal of promise. He has published a book or
two, I believe. And in the second place, my wife
is very much concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always seems to be the trouble, doesn&#8217;t it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Enter a romance!&#8221; Dr. Irwin waved his hand
widely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a romance. To tell the truth, Irwin,
Mrs. Goodno knows of the young woman, and I
can&#8217;t tell you how anxious she is about him.
There&#8217;s nothing sadder to me than a case like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; the other said, &#8220;that&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a
married man. The rest of us haven&#8217;t time to
grow sympathetic. I should say that the particular
young woman would be a great deal better
off, judging from present indications, if he
<i>did</i> die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, if he should recover from this septic
condition, he&#8217;s more than likely to be a stick for
the rest of his life. It&#8217;s even chances he never
puts foot to the ground again. Such men are
better dead, and if you gave them their choice,
most of them would prefer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was as bad as that. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Faulkner&#8217;s earlier prognosis was more favorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t like his temperature of the
last two days. He&#8217;s got septic symptoms, and
you know how quickly such a course ends. Well,
we&#8217;ll soon know, though that&#8217;s more consolation
to us than it might be to him, I suppose.&#8221; He
drummed with his fingers on the arm of the chair.
&#8220;As for the girl,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Love? Pshaw!
She&#8217;ll get over it. What sensible woman, when
she&#8217;s got beyond the mooning age and the foreign
missionary age, wants a cripple for a husband?
If this patient should live in that way,
this girl you speak of would probably get the
silly notion that she wanted to marry him&mdash;trust
a woman, especially a young woman, for that!
If she&#8217;s beautiful or wealthy, or particularly talented,
it&#8217;s all the more likely she would insist on
tying herself up to him and nurse him and feed
him gruel till her hair was gray. And what
would she get out of it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&#8220;There might be worse lives than that.&#8221; Dr.
Goodno spoke reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;For her, I presume you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Woman&#8217;s love is less of a physical affinity
and more a consciousness of spiritual attraction
than man&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Teach your women that. It&#8217;s not without
its merits as a working doctrine. The time a
woman isn&#8217;t thinking about servants or babies
she generally spends thinking about her soul.
The word soul to her is as fascinating as a canary
to an Angora cat. She takes so much stock in
heaven only because she&#8217;s been told it isn&#8217;t material.
Your material philosophies were all invented
and patented by men; it&#8217;s the women who
keep your spiritual religions running.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would <i>you</i> have it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right as far as heaven goes! Let
them believe anything they want to. But when
you bring the all-soul idea down into every-day
life, it&#8217;s mawkish. When you go about preaching
that love is a spiritual &#8216;affinity,&#8217; for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may believe it, understand. But you
gloss over the other side. The general opinion
is that &#8216;bodily&#8217; isn&#8217;t a nice word to use when we
discuss love. You and I, as physicians, see every
day the results of this dislike to recognize the
material side in what has been called the &#8216;young
person.&#8217; Women are taught from childhood to
regard the immensely human and emotional sensibilities
as linked to sin. The sex-stirring in
them, they are led to imagine evil and a wrong
to possess. They are taught instinctively to condemn
rather than to respect the growth and indications
of their own natures. The profound
attraction of one sex to the other which marks the
purest and most ennobling passion&mdash;the trembling
delight in the merest touch or caress&mdash;the
bodily thrill at the passing presence or footfall of
the one beloved&mdash;these they come to believe a
shame to feel and a death to confess. It is the
teaching that makes for the morbid. A great
deal of mental suffering which leaves its mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
upon the growing woman might be avoided if
men and women were more honest with themselves.
A soulless woman is just as much use in
the world as a bodiless one&mdash;or a man either, for
that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Goodno regarded him musingly. &#8220;Granted
there is a good deal of truth in what you say,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;When I spoke of woman&#8217;s love as more
of a spiritual and less of a material affinity than
man&#8217;s, I meant that it does not require so much
from the senses to feed upon. Sex has a psychology,
and it is a fact which has been universally
noted that all that concerns the mental aspect
of sex is exhibited in greater proportionate
force by women. Does not this seem to imply
that love to a woman is more of a mental element
and less of a physical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! More of a mental, but only so
because more of a physical, too. All love&#8217;s mental
delights come originally from the physical
side. How many women do you see falling in
love with twisted faces and crooked joints? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
hand stands for a hand-clasp; a face for a kiss!
Love becomes a &#8216;spiritual&#8217; passion only after it
has blossomed on physical expression. Not before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your view were the correct one,&#8221; pursued
Irwin, &#8220;women, in all their habitual acts of fascination
(which are Nature&#8217;s precursors of love)
would strive more to touch the mental, the spiritual
side of men. But they don&#8217;t. They apply
their own self-learned reasoning to the opposite
sex. They decorate themselves for man with the
feathers of male birds (you&#8217;ll find that in your
Darwin), which Nature gave the male birds to
charm the females. They strike at his senses,
and they hit his mental side, when he has any,
through them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sad misogynist, Irwin!&#8221; Dr. Goodno
was smiling, but there was a sub-note of earnestness
beneath the lightness of his tone. &#8220;And you
forget that women have an imaginative and ideal
side which is superior to man&#8217;s. They can create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the mental, possibly, where men are most dependent
upon sense-impression. Love involves
more of the soul in woman, Irwin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The house surgeon unwound his legs. &#8220;Or
less,&#8221; he said tersely. &#8220;Havelock Ellis says a good
thing. He says that while a man may be said to
live on a plane, a woman is more apt to live on
the upward or downward slope of a curve. She
is always going up or coming down. That&#8217;s
why a woman, when an artificial civilization
hasn&#8217;t stepped in to forbid it, is forever talking
about her health. And, spiritually, as well as
physically, she is just as apt to be coming down
as going up. Her proportion is wrong. Your
bad woman disrespects her soul; your good
woman disrespects her body. The wholesome
woman disrespects neither and respects both. But
very few young women are wholesome nowadays.
Their training has been against it! The best
way for a woman to treat her soul is to realize
that her soul and body belong together, and have
to live together the rest of her natural life. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
needn&#8217;t forget this just because she happens to
fall in love! No woman can marry a man whom
accident has robbed of his physical side and not
wrong herself. She shuts off the avenues of her
senses. There is no thrill of ear or hand&mdash;no
comeliness for her eye to dwell upon, and her
spiritual love, so beautiful to begin with, starves
itself slowly to death!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good on general principles,&#8221; said Dr.
Goodno. &#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble. It&#8217;s easy enough
to sermonize in the pulpit, or the clinic either, but
when we come to concrete examples, it&#8217;s difficult.
The particular instance is troublesome. Now, in
the case of this man in the surgical ward, if he
recovered at all, but remained a hopeless cripple,
you would pack him off into a rayless solitude
for the rest of his life, and tell the girl who loves
him to go and love somebody else. You wouldn&#8217;t
leave it to her&mdash;even if he was willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I would be afraid to arrogate to myself
the judgment upon two human souls. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
times when what we call consistency vanishes and
something greater and more noble stands up to
make it ashamed. I&#8217;ll tell you now, Irwin, if the
one woman in the world to me&mdash;the woman I
loved&mdash;if my wife&mdash;had been brought where the
case we&#8217;ve been speaking of promises to be&mdash;if
there were nothing but her eyes left and the
something that is back of them&mdash;I tell you, I&#8217;d
have married her! Yes, and I&#8217;d have thanked
God for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion tossed the dead butt of his
cigar into the grate and rose to go to the ward.
&#8220;Goodno,&#8221; he said, and his voice was unsteady,
&#8220;I believe it! You would; and I wish to the
Lord I knew what that meant!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The superintendent sat long thinking. He
was still pondering when his wife entered the
room. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been talking with Irwin,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;about the last trephine case&mdash;the one you
spoke to me of. He doesn&#8217;t seem too hopeful,
I&#8217;m sorry to say.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>She did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I saw your new
nurse protégée to-day. Langdon, I believe her
name is. She is a lovely girl; I think I never
saw a brighter, sweeter face in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Goodno had gone to the window and
stood looking out. &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve bad
news. Dr. Faulkner has just seen Mr. Daunt,
and&mdash;he is dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in her voice caught him. He rose
and came beside her, and saw that her eyes were
full of tears. He drew her head to his shoulder
and smoothed her hair gently. He could feel her
hands quiver against his arm. His thoughts fled
far away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;where the one for whose
sorrow she cried must be uncomforted. &#8220;Poor
girl! Poor girl!&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX.</h2></div>


<p>As they entered the room, Lois turned the key
in its lock and bent a long, penetrating gaze on
Margaret.</p>

<p>She lay huddled against the welter of bedclothes,
silent, inert, pearl-pale spots on her
cheeks like gray-white smothers of foam over
fretting rocks. Her eyes were closed and her
breath came chokingly, like a child&#8217;s after a
draught of strong medicine. Suddenly, as Lois
stood pondering, she kneeled upright on the bed,
holding her arms out before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t let him die!
Please don&#8217;t! He can&#8217;t&mdash;he can&#8217;t die! Why,
he&#8217;s Richard&mdash;Richard Daunt. It&#8217;s only an accident.
He can&#8217;t die that way. God&mdash;God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, dear! Oh, dear! What can I say?&#8221;
cried Lois.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>Margaret slipped to the floor, dragging the
covers with her, and burying her face in the fleecy
cuddle. There she writhed like some trodden
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear God!&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;just when I
knew. He can&#8217;t die now! It&#8217;s just to punish
me; I&#8217;ve been wicked, but I didn&#8217;t mean to be.
I only wanted his good! If he had only died before
I knew it! Only let him live till I can tell
him, God. I&#8217;m not a wicked woman&mdash;you know
how I tried. A wicked woman wouldn&#8217;t have
tried. Oh, God, he doesn&#8217;t even know! I can&#8217;t
tell him. I&#8217;ve suffered already. If he died, I
couldn&#8217;t feel worse than I have all this time. Let
me think he&#8217;s going to die, but don&#8217;t let him.
<i>Don&#8217;t let him!</i> I want him so! It isn&#8217;t for that
that I want him! I know now. I thought it
was the other. But I wasn&#8217;t so wicked as that.
I&#8217;ve been selfish. I&#8217;ve been thinking I was good
to keep him away, but I wasn&#8217;t. I was cruel.
He loved me the right way. Oh, if I could only
forget how he talked!&mdash;and he didn&#8217;t know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he was saying. I&#8217;ve hated myself ever since. If
he dies, I shall hate myself forever! I don&#8217;t deserve
that! I&#8217;m not so bad as that! I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i>
be. I&#8217;m willing to be punished in other ways&mdash;in
any other way&mdash;but not this, God! I can&#8217;t
stand it!</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ask for him as he was! I don&#8217;t care
how he looks! Give him to me just as he is.
Give him to me crippled and helpless, and let me
care for him all my life. Oh, God, it isn&#8217;t so
much that I ask! It&#8217;s such a little thing for you
to grant! Why, every day you let some one get
well, some one who isn&#8217;t half as much to anybody
as he is to me. If I were asking something I
oughtn&#8217;t to&mdash;something sinful, it would be different!
But it can&#8217;t be bad to want him to get well!
I&#8217;ll be better all my life to have him. It isn&#8217;t
much&mdash;I&#8217;ll never ask you anything else as long as
I live! Only let him live&mdash;don&#8217;t take him away!
I don&#8217;t care if he can never walk again, if he can
only know me, and love me still! God, his life is
so precious to me; it&#8217;s worth more than all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
world. If he died, I would want to die, too. God!
Hasn&#8217;t he suffered enough? How can you watch
him&mdash;how can you see what he is suffering now
and not let him live? You can if you want to!
There are so many millions and millions of
people, and this is just one of them. Oh, for
Christ&#8217;s sake&mdash;for Christ&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Margaret! Margaret!&#8221; wailed Lois, falling
beside her, as though physical contact could
soothe her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go on like that! Don&#8217;t!
Oh, it&#8217;s too cruel! You break my heart! Darling,
darling! He isn&#8217;t dead yet. Maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She stopped then, choking, but pressing
her hands hard on Margaret&#8217;s cheeks, on her hair,
on her breast, her limbs, as though to press back
the nerves that she felt throbbed to bursting.</p>

<p>Margaret struggled to her feet, swaying with
the paroxysm just passed. Her eyes were unwet
and bright, and her teeth were clenched tightly
on her under lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t dead,&#8221; she said slowly, as though
to force conviction on herself. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t&mdash;dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Doctors are mistaken sometimes, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
she asked dully. &#8220;Yes, I know! They are!
Dr. Irwin told me so himself. &#8216;The prognostications
of surgery can in no case be considered infallible.&#8217;
That&#8217;s what he said in the lecture yesterday.
I wrote it down in my note-book. That
means that he may not die. Oh! I&#8217;ve got to believe
that. <i>I&#8217;ve got to!</i> Can&#8217;t you see that I&#8217;ve
got to? You don&#8217;t believe he will live! I see it
in your face. When the doctor said that just
now, you looked just as he did. He might have
stabbed me just as well. Why! I&#8217;d rather die
myself a million times&mdash;but it wouldn&#8217;t do any
good! It wouldn&#8217;t do any good!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret moved to the fire and spread out her
hands before the blaze, as though her mind unconsciously
sought relief from strain in an habitual
action. But her chattering teeth showed that
she was unconscious of its warmth.</p>

<p>She looked up at the countenance of La Belle
Jardinière above the fireplace. The mild gaze
which had once held reproach now seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
bend down full of pitiful tenderness. Her
bright, miserable eyes rested on the placid figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;what I
am praying for. If it were a little child&mdash;<i>my</i>
little child&mdash;that I were asking for, you would
understand. You can only pity me, but you can
never, never know!&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and walked up and down the floor,
her steps uneven with anguish, her fingers laced
and unlaced in tearless convulsion, and her throat
contracting with soundless sobs.</p>

<p>Lois watched her, her mind saying over and
over to itself: &#8220;If she would only cry! If she
would only cry!&#8221; There was something more
terrible than tears in this inarticulate anguish.
At last she went and stood in Margaret&#8217;s way,
clinging entreatingly to her. &#8220;Do let me help
you, dear! Lie down and let me cover you up
and make you some tea! Do please, dear!&#8221; She
stopped, struck by the ashy pallor of her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Lois. I can&#8217;t stay here! Think!
He may be dying <i>now</i>! I <i>must</i> go to him! Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
you have got to let me&mdash;they can&#8217;t forbid me that.
I was going to stay with him to-night, anyway.
You know I was! I can&#8217;t let him die! He
<i>shan&#8217;t</i>! I&#8217;ll fight it off with him. I don&#8217;t care
what Dr. Faulkner says; I don&#8217;t care what you
think! You mustn&#8217;t say no, Lois! Oh, Lois,
darling! I&#8217;ll die now, right here, if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
She dropped on her knees at Lois&#8217;s feet, catching
her hand and kissing it in grovelling entreaty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ll have to let you, if you ask like
that!&#8221; cried Lois. &#8220;I&#8217;m only thinking of you&mdash;and
of him,&#8221; she added. &#8220;You know if you
should break down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I won&#8217;t&mdash;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; A gulping hiccough
strained her, and Lois poured out a glass of water
for her hastily, and stood over her while she
swallowed it in choking mouthfuls.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XX.</h2></div>


<p>In the dimmed light Margaret bent above
Daunt&#8217;s bed to wipe away the creeping, beady
sweat that lay on the forehead, and laid her fingers
on his wrist. Then she came close to Lois.
She had bitten her lip raw and her neck throbbed
out and in above her close collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fluttering,&#8221; she whispered piteously, &#8220;and
he&#8217;s so cold! See how pinched and blue his nose
is. Oh, God&mdash;Lois!&#8221;</p>

<p>The rustle and stir of the early waking city
soaked in fine-filtered sounds through the window.
Of what use were its multitudinous strivings,
its tangled hopes, its varied suffering? The
unending quiet of softened noises beyond the
spotless, ruffled screens hurt her. She could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
screamed, inarticulately, frantically, to scare away
that dreadful, stolid, lethargic thing that sprawled
in the air. Her nails left little, curved, purpled
dents in her palms that smarted when she unclenched
her fingers. It would be easier to bear
it if he cried out&mdash;if he babbled unmeaningness,
or hurled reproaches. Only&mdash;that still prostration,
that anxious expression about the lines of
the forehead, that silence, growing into&mdash;&mdash; No,
no! Not that! Not&mdash;death!</p>

<p>Lois sat aching fiercely at the smouldering
longing in the shadowy depths of the other&#8217;s
spaniel-like eyes. The tawny-brown surge of her
hair, swept back from her forehead, stood out
against the white of the blank wall, cameo-like.
She suddenly crouched by Lois&#8217;s chair, grasping
at her. &#8220;Lois, Lois!&#8221; she said, low and with
fearful intensity; &#8220;it&#8217;s come! Help me to fight
it! Help me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has come? What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fear! It&#8217;s looking at me everywhere. It&#8217;s
looking between the screens! I must keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
away. If I give up to it, he&#8217;ll die! Press my
hands&mdash;that&#8217;s good. Look at him! Didn&#8217;t he
move then? Wasn&#8217;t his face turned more? I&#8217;m&mdash;cold,
Lois.&#8221;</p>

<p>An icy frost had silvered her soul. Gaunt
arms seemed to stretch from the dimness toward
the bed. Then, with an effort which left her
weak, she thrust back her imaginings, rose, and
sat down by the pillow. Her eyes glanced fearfully
from side to side, then above, as though
questioning from what direction would come this
relentless foe.</p>

<p>Through her dazed brain rushed, clamorous,
reiterating, a prayer-blent, defiant appeal. She
saw God sitting on a draped throne, but His face
was merciless. He would not help her! Of
what virtue was this all-filling love of hers if it
could not save one little human life? He was
dying&mdash;dying&mdash;dying! And he <i>must not</i> die!
She remembered a night, far back in her misty
childhood, when she had crept through evening
shadows to see a soul take flight. The Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Angel then was a kindly friend sent to set free a
shining twin; now it was a ghastly monster, lying
in wait and chuckling in the silences.</p>

<p>She pressed Daunt&#8217;s nerveless hand between
her warm palms and strove to put the whole
force of her being into a great passionate desire&mdash;a
desire to send along this human conductivity
the extra current of vitality which she felt throbbing
and pressing in her every vein. It seemed
as though she must give&mdash;give of her own bounding
life, to eke out the fading powers of that
dying frame. Again and again she breathed out
her longing, until the very intensity of her will
made her feel dizzy and weak. She would have
opened her veins for him. Like the Roman
daughter, she would have given her breast to his
lips and the warmth from her limbs to aid him.</p>

<p>Once she started. &#8220;You shall! You shall!&#8221;
seemed to patter in flying echoes all about her.
It was Daunt&#8217;s cry by the fields at Warne, that
had gone leaping from his lips to her heart like
a vibrant, inspiring fire. Did that virile will still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
lie living, overlapped with the wing of disease,
sending its stubborn strength out now to bolster
her own? She glanced at the waxy face, half expecting
to see the bloodless lips falling back from
the words.</p>

<p>Daunt lay motionless. The ice-pack had been
removed from his head, and the shaven temple
showed paste-like beneath the bandage-edge.
From time to time Lois poured between his lips a
teaspoonful of diluted brandy, and, at such times,
Margaret would put her strong arms under his
head and raise it from the pillow, outwardly calm,
but inwardly shuddering with wrenching jerks
of pain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the slow, weary night dragged away. The
house surgeon looked in once, bent over the patient
a moment, and, without examination, went
away.</p>

<p>The morning broke, and through the walls the
dim, murmurous hum of street traffic penetrated
in a muffled whisper. Then the gray of the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
dawn crept about the room, noiseless-footed, like
one walking over graves. Suddenly Lois, who
had been sitting with closed eyes, felt a touch on
her shoulder. It was Margaret, and she pointed
silently to Daunt. Lois started forward with a
shrinking fear that the end had come unperceived,
but a glance reassured her. The rigid
outlines of his features seemed to have relaxed;
an indefinable something, a warmth, a tinge, a
flexibility seemed to have fallen upon the drawn
cheeks. It was something scarce tangible enough
to be noted; something evasive, and yet, to Lois&#8217;s
trained senses, unmistakable. It was a light
loosening of the grip of Death, a tentative withdrawing
of the forces of the destroyer.</p>

<p>Lois turned with a quick and silent gesture,
and the two girls looked at each other steadfastly.
Into Margaret&#8217;s eyes sprang a trembling, eager
light of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t hope too much, dear,&#8221; Lois whispered,
&#8220;but I think&mdash;I think that there is a little
change. Wait until I call Dr. Irwin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>The house surgeon bent over the cot with his
finger upon Daunt&#8217;s pulse. &#8220;This is another one
on Faulkner,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It beats all how things
will go. Said he&#8217;d give him twelve hours, did
he? Well, this patient has his own ideas about
that. He evidently has marvellous recuperative
powers or else the age of miracles isn&#8217;t past. Better
watch this case very carefully and report to
me every hour or so. You can count,&#8221; he smiled
at Lois, &#8220;on being mighty unpopular with Faulkner.
He doesn&#8217;t like to have his opinions reversed
this way, and he is pretty sure to lay it on
the nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the doctor disappeared, all the strength
which Margaret had summoned to her aid seemed
to vanish in one great wave of weakening which
overspread her spirit. Everything swam before
her eyes. She sank upon the chair and laid
her arms outstretched upon the table. Then she
slowly dropped her head upon them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXI.</h2></div>


<p>It was late afternoon. The fiery sun had just
dipped below the jagged Adirondack hill-peaks
to the south, still casting a carmine glow between
the scattered and low-boughed pines. The
square window of the high-ceiled sanitarium
room was specked with pale-appearing stars, and
the snow-draped slopes beneath showed dim in
the elusive beauty that lurks in soft color and low
tones. Daunt lay silent, facing the window, and
Margaret, tired from romping with the doctor&#8217;s
children, rested on a low hassock beside his reclining
chair. Slowly the carmine faded from the
snow, and the hastening winter-dark trailed its
violescent gossamer up and down the rock-clefts
and across the purpling hollows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>He turned his eyes, all at once feeling her lifted
gaze. He reached out his right hand and touched
the lace edge of her white nurse&#8217;s cap, with a faint
smile. Something in the smile and the gesture
caught at her heart. She leaned suddenly
toward him, and taking his hand in both her own,
laid her face upon it.</p>

<p>He drew his hand away, breathing sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you remember that
afternoon on the sands? You kissed me then!
I am the same Margaret now&mdash;not changed
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>A shudder passed over him, but he did not
reply.</p>

<p>Then she knelt beside him, quite close, laying
her cheek by his face on the pillow and drawing
his one live hand up to her lips. &#8220;You are everything
to me,&#8221; she whispered&mdash;&#8220;everything, everything!
That day on the beach I was happy; but
not more happy, dear, than I am now. You were
everything else in the world to me then, but now
you are <i>me</i>, myself! Don&#8217;t turn away; look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
me!&#8221; Reaching over, she drew his nerveless left
arm across her neck.</p>

<p>He turned his face to her with an effort, his
lips struggling to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss me!&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>He tried to push her back. &#8220;No! No!&#8221; he
cried vehemently, drawing away. &#8220;That&#8217;s past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even that! Just think how long I&#8217;ve
waited!&#8221; She was smiling. &#8220;Richard,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;do you know what it means for a woman to
kneel to a man like this? I haven&#8217;t a bit of pride
about it. Only think how ashamed I will be if
you refuse to take me! What does a woman do
when a man refuses her?&#8221;</p>

<p>A white pain had settled upon Daunt&#8217;s face.
&#8220;Margaret,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;don&#8217;t; I can&#8217;t stand it!
You don&#8217;t know what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed his hand again. &#8220;Yes, I do! I am
saying just as plainly as I can that I love you;
that I belong to you, and that I ask for nothing
else but to belong to you as long as I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand made a motion of protest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>&#8220;I want you just as much as I did the day you
first kissed me. I want the right to stay with you
always and care for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He winced visibly. &#8220;&#8216;Care for me!&#8217;&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;It would be <i>all</i> care. I have nothing
to bring you now but sorrow and regret. I&#8217;m
not the Daunt who offered himself to you at
Warne. I&#8217;m only a fragment. I had health and
hopes then. I had beautiful dreams, Margaret&mdash;dreams
of work and a home and you. I shan&#8217;t
ever forget those dreams, but they can never
come true!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smoothed his hand caressingly. &#8220;I have
had dreams, too,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;This is the
one that comes oftenest of all. It is about you
and me.&#8221; She turned her head, with a spot of
color in either cheek. &#8220;Sometimes it is in the
day. You are lying, writing away at a new book
of yours, and I am filling your pipe for you, while
the tea is getting hot. I see you smile up to me
and say, &#8216;Clever girl! how did you know I wanted
a smoke?&#8217; Then you read your last chapter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
me, and I tell you how I wouldn&#8217;t have said it the
way the woman in the story does, and you pretend
you are going to change it, and don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes it is in the evening, and we are
looking out at the sunset just as we have been
doing to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would have spoken, but she covered his
mouth with her hand. His moist breath wrapped
her palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then it is dark and there is a big red lamp
on the table&mdash;the one I had in my old room&mdash;and
I am reading the latest novel to you, and when
we have got to the end, you are telling me how
you would have done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>While she had been speaking, glowing and
dark-eyed, a mystical peace&mdash;a divine forgetfulness
had touched him. He lifted his hand to his
forehead, feeling her soft fingers. The pictures
she painted were so sweet!</p>

<p>Presently he threw his arm down with a swallowed
sob. The dream-scene faded, and he lay
once more helpless and despairing, weighted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the heaviness of useless limbs, a numb burden for
whom there could be no love, no joy, nothing but
the inevitable rebuke of enduring pain. He
smoothed the wide dun-gold waves of her hair
gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not for such a sacrifice, Margaret,&#8221;
he said sadly. &#8220;I am not such a coward. You
are a woman&mdash;a perfect, beautiful woman&mdash;the
kind that God made all happiness for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t be happy without you!&#8221; she
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor with me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve got
to face it! All the long years I should watch
that womanhood of yours growing dimmer and
less full, your outlook narrowing, your life&#8217;s sympathies
shrinking. I shall be shut up to myself
and grow away from the world, but you shall not
grow away from it with me! It would be a
crime! I should come to hate myself. I want
you to live your life out worthily. I would
rather remember you as you are now, and as
loving me once for what I was!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Margaret&#8217;s eyes were closed. She was thinking
of Melwin and Lydia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman needs more to fill her life than the
love of a man&#8217;s mind. She wants more, dear.
She wants the love of the heart-beat. She wants
home&mdash;the home I wanted to make for you&mdash;the
kind I used to dream of&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His voice
broke here and failed.</p>

<p>The door pushed open without a knock. A
tiny night-gowned figure stood swaying on the
sill, outlined sharply against the glare of lamp-light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vere&#8217;s &#8217;iss Mar&#8217;det?&#8221; he said in high baby
key. &#8220;I yants her to tiss me dood-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s hand still lay against Daunt&#8217;s cheek,
and as she drew it away, she felt a great hot tear
suddenly wet her fingers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XXII.</h2></div>


<p>Snow had fallen in the night&mdash;a wet snow,
mingled with sleet and fleering rain. It had
spread a flashing, silver sheen over the vast
wastes, and the sun glinted and laughed from a
web of woven jewels. It gleamed from every
needle of the stalwart evergreens, which stood
around in dazzling ice-armor, keeping guard
above the virgin snow asleep, with its white
curves dimpling beside the rough, bearish mountains.
Overhead the sky bent in tranquil baby-blue.</p>

<p>The beauty of the frozen morning hung cheerily
about the row of pillowed chairs wheeled before
the glass sides of the long sun-parlor. To
some who gazed from these chairs it was a
glimpse of the world into which they would soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
return; to others it was but the symbol of another
weary winter of lengthening waiting. But
to each it brought a comfort and a hope.</p>

<p>The same fair whiteness of the outdoors shone
mockingly through Daunt&#8217;s window. Its very
loveliness seemed cruel, with that insidious raillery
with which Nature, be she gloomy or bright,
fits our darker moods. Through the night, while
Margaret&#8217;s phantom touch lay upon his forehead,
and the ghosts of her kisses crept across his hand,
he had fought with his longing, and he had won.
But it was a triumphless victory. The pulpy
ashes of his own denial were in his mouth. He
had asked so little&mdash;only to see her, to hear her
step, and the lisping movement of her dress, and
the cadence of her voice&mdash;only to feel the touch
of her fingers and the drench of her warm, young
life! She loved him; his love, he told himself,
incomplete as it was, would take the place of all
for her. And in his heart he told himself that
he lied!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>But the rayless darkness of that inner room
cast no shadow in the cozy sun-parlor. There,
the doctor, with youthful step that belied his
graying hair, strode about among the patients,
chatting lightly, and full of good-natured badinage.
Then, leaving them smiling, he went back
to his private office. As he entered, Margaret
rose from the chair where she waited, and came
hurriedly toward him. She was pale, and her
slender hands were clasping nervously about her
wrists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; she began, and stopped an instant.
Then stumblingly, &#8220;I have just got your note. I
came to ask you&mdash;I want to beg you to&mdash;not to
make me go back! I&mdash;want to stay so much!
I know so well how to wait on him. You know
I wasn&#8217;t a regular nurse at the hospital. It was
only a trial. Dr. Goodno doesn&#8217;t expect me
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew out a chair for her and made her sit
down, wiping his glasses laboriously. &#8220;My dear
child&mdash;Miss Langdon&mdash;&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
you feel. My good friend Mrs. Goodno wrote
me of you when Mr. Daunt came to us. She is
a splendid, noble-hearted woman, and she wrote
of you as though you were her own daughter.
You see,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;when you first came, it
was suspected that Mr. Daunt&#8217;s peculiar paralysis
might be of a hysteric type, and might yield
naturally, under treatment, with a bettering physical
condition, or, possibly, under the impulse of
some extra nervous stimulus. Such cases are not
unmet with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she said anxiously.</p>

<p>He polished his glasses again. &#8220;I am sorry to
say,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that we have long ago abandoned
this hope, as you know. Such being the
case, it seems, under the peculiar circumstances,
advisable&mdash;that is, it would be better not to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He stopped, feeling that he was floundering in
deeper water than he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you only knew!&#8221; Margaret&#8217;s voice
was shaking. &#8220;I came here because I love him,
doctor, and because he loved me! Surely I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
at least stay by him. I am experienced enough
to nurse him. It&#8217;s the only thing left now for me
to be happy in. He wants me! He&#8217;s more cheerful
when I am with him. I know he doesn&#8217;t
really need a special nurse, but&mdash;I don&#8217;t have to
earn the money for it. I do it because I like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; the doctor said, wheeling,
with suspicious abruptness, in his chair, &#8220;be
sure that it is only your own best good that is
considered. There are cruel facts in life that we
have to face. This seems very hard for you now,
I know. It <i>is</i> hard! He is a brave man, and believe
me, my child, he knows best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret half rose from her seat. &#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;?&mdash;<i>he</i>
knows best&mdash;Richard? Does <i>he</i> say&mdash;did Mr.
Daunt&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand as a father might. &#8220;It was
not easy for him,&#8221; he said simply.</p>

<p>She bowed her head in piteous acquiescence,
and held his fingers a moment, her lips striving
courageously for a smile, and then went silently
out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>As she passed Daunt&#8217;s closed door on the way
to her room, she stretched out her arms and
touched its dark panels softly, fearfully, and then
leaned forward, and once laid her lips against the
hard grained wood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later, from where he lay, Daunt could
see the bulbous, ulstered figure of the colored
driver as he waited by the porch to take his single
passenger to the distant Lake station. He could
see the rake of the horses&#8217; ears as the man swung
his arms, pounding his sides to keep the blood
circulating. His steamy breath made a curdling
smoke-cloud about his peaked cap.</p>

<p>Daunt&#8217;s blood forged painfully as the square
ormolu clock on the mantel pointed near to the
hour. There were lines of sleeplessness beneath
his eyes; his face was instinct with suffering.
Through his open door came the mingled tones
of conversation in the rooms beyond.</p>

<p>He was sitting up, his vigorous hair, grown
over-long during his illness, blending its hue with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that of the dark chair-cushion. The white collar
that he wore seemed to have lent its pallor to
his cheeks.</p>

<p>He felt himself to have aged during the night.
Through the long weeks since his accident, he
had hoped against hope. The doctors had talked
speciously of change of scene and bracing mountain
air. He had been glad enough to leave the
foreboding atmosphere of the hospital for this
more cheery hill-top harbor. He had never
known nor asked by what arrangement Margaret
was now with him; it had seemed only natural
that it should be so. His patches of delirium
memories were every one brightened by her face
and touch, and this state had merged itself gradually
into the waking consciousness when she was
always by. Without questioning, he had come
to realize that whatever might have risen between
them in the past was forever gone, and rested
content in her near presence and the promise of
the future.</p>

<p>But as the weeks dragged themselves by he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
come to know, with a kind slowness of realization,
that this hope must die. In their late talks,
both of them had tacitly recognized this. In the
night of his growing despair, she had been his
one star. Now he must shut out that ray with
his own hands and turn his face to the intolerable
dark.</p>

<p>When her head had been next his on the pillow,
with his nostrils full of the clean, grassy
fragrance of her hair&mdash;when her hand had closed
his lips and her voice had plead with him, he
had seen, as through a lightning-rift, the enormity
of the selfishness with which he had let his
soul be tempted. From that moment there was
for him but one way&mdash;<i>this</i> way. And he had accepted
it unflinchingly, heroically.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The spring of the wide stairway broke and
turned half way up, and from where he sat his
eye sighted the landing and that slim figure coming
slowly down. It was the old Margaret in
street dress. Above the fur of her close, fawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
cloth coat, her hopeless eyes looked over the
balustrade along which her slight, gloved hand
slid weakly, as though seeking support for her
limbs.</p>

<p>She crossed the threshold and came toward
him, with her eyes half closed, as though in a
maze of grief. The hollows beneath them looked
bruised, and her features pinched like a child&#8217;s
with the cold. Gropingly and blindly, one hand
reached out to him, the other she pressed close
to her throat. She was bathed in a wave of violent
trembling.</p>

<p>Every stretching fibre in Daunt&#8217;s being responded.
He could feel the shuddering palpitation
through her suède glove. His self-restraint
hung about him like heavy chains, which the
quiver of an eyelash, the impulse of a sigh, would
start into clamorous vibration.</p>

<p>He looked up and their eyes met once. Her
gaze clung to him. His lips formed, rather than
spoke, the word &#8220;Good-by.&#8221; Then he put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
hand aside and turned his head from her, not to
see her go.</p>

<p>His strained ear heard her uncertain footfalls,
and the agony of his mind counted them! Now
she was by the table. Now her hand was on the
knob. Now&mdash;&mdash; He sprang around, facing her
at the sound of a stumble and a dulled blow; she
had pitched forward against the opened door,
swaying&mdash;about to fall.</p>

<p>As her knees touched the floor, a scream burst
shrill in the silence of the room&mdash;a scream that
pierced the drowsy quiet of the sun-parlor and
brought the doctor running through the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221;</p>

<p>Its intensity dragged her from the swoon. She
turned her head. Daunt was standing in the
middle of the floor, his eyes shining with fluctuant
fire, his arms&mdash;<i>both</i> arms&mdash;stretched out
toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;Margaret! I
can walk!&#8221;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
